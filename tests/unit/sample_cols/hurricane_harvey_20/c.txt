RAPID CITY, S.D. (KOTA TV) - Water brings people together and that song rings true in Rapid City.
The Black Hills Flood of 1972 shook this town many years ago so people in Rapid City know all too well what water is capable of.
The Emmanuel Episcopal Church in downtown Rapid City served authentic Gulf Coast chicken and sausage gumbo to help victims in Houston affected by Hurricane Harvey.
Both Reverend Chris Roussell and his wife were living in New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina hit so they know how much this fundraiser can help.
“As a person who experienced Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana in 2005, the emotional impact is as devastating, as is the financial impact,” says Roussell. “So knowing that you're being supported and loved and cared for by people all over the country really did mean a lot at that time to us.  Just trying to show some love for those in need in Texas."
The church ended up raising around $13,000 once the fundraiser was complete.
If you missed the gumbo fundraiser, we are sorry to say you might have missed out on this Cajun delicacy, but you can still donate.
Just send a check to Emmanuel Episcopal Church at 717 Quincy Street and put in the memo line “gumbo” so they know to send financial aid down to Texas.

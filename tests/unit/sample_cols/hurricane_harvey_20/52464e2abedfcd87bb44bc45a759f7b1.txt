CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — Hurricane Harvey decimated communities along the Gulf Coast of Texas and left large swaths of the Lone Star State underwater when it roared ashore about three weeks ago.
Now those communities are trying to pick up the pieces .
In Port Aransas, some structures appear to have dodged total devastation from the outside, but piles of furniture and carpeting growing along the roads are evident of the 5-feet of storm surge that covered the town. 
To the south end of the seaside community, there's a large pile of debris being created from the various smaller piles around town.

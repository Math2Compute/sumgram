Three of the Coastal Bend high schools most ravaged by Hurricane Harvey have suspended their football seasons, and that will have an impact on other South Texas programs.
On the days following the category 4 hurricane making landfall, the communities of Rockport, Aransas Pass and Ingleside continue to cope with loss and massive property damage. In the wake of assessing the damage, school officials from the three communities have decided to suspend their football seasons and athletic programs.
Among other events, that means Robstown’s season-opener against Ingleside on Friday and the Sept. 8 game between Aransas Pass and Orange Grove are canceled.
Coaches from Rockport-Fulton, Aransas Pass and Ingleside have said they hope to resume athletics are the three high schools to help return the communities to normalcy, but there are no firm plans.
Aside from damages to the communities, each of the school’s athletic facilities also suffered damages.
At Rockport-Fulton High School, the storm destroyed the school’s gym and caused some damages to the bleachers in the stadium and locker room facilities.
Aransas Pass’ Bo Bonorden Memorial Stadium had both press boxes destroyed. There was also heavy damage to the school baseball and softball fields.
At Ingleside High School, the football field lost light poles and goal posts.

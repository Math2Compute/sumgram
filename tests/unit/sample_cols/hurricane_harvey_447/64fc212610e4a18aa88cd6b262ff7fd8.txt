Exxon Mobil is in the process of shutting down the nation's second-largest refining complex in Baytown in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.
The Baytown campus, which also produces petrochemicals, can churn through up to 560,000 barrels of oil a day to produce fuel. The refinery is a major source of the Gulf Coast and nation's gasoline supplies. Baytown also serves as a major petrochemical hub that's undergoing a massive expansion.
"Safety is our first priority, and we have taken all the precautions to minimize impact to community and employees throughout the shutdown process," Exxon Mobil spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said.

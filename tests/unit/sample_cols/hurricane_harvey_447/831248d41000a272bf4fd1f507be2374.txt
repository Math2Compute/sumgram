Aug. 10 (UPI) -- The National Hurricane Center on Thursday said Hurricane Franklin weakened to a tropical storm after hitting Mexico and moving further inland.
The NHC said Franklin was about 75 miles south of Tuxpan, Mexico, at 4 a.m. CDT Thursday. The tropical storm is moving west at a speed of 15 mph and has maximum sustained winds of 70 mph.
Forecasters said tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles, mainly to the northeast of the storm's center. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the eastern coast of Mexico from Cabo Rojo to Punta Roca Partida.
Mexico's government has canceled the hurricane watch and warning for the eastern coast. Mexico City's Civil Protection Secretariat has warned residents of "light precipitation" throughout the day.
The NHC said Franklin is expected to further weaken as it moves across Mexico and will likely dissipate late Thursday or early Friday. It's expected to produce from 4-8 inches of rain with up to 15 inches in isolated parts of some central states.
"These rains are capable of producing life-threatening flash floods and mudslides," the NHC said.
Hurricane Franklin made landfall in the central Gulf Coast of Mexico as a category 1 hurricane Wednesday night. Serious damage was not immediately reported.
Franklin is the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2017 season.

What would happen if San Antonio received a Hurricane Harvey-level storm? These striking simulations show how creeks and rivers would rise and potentially devastate various parts of the city, according to the San Antonio River Authority.

San Antonio might not flood exactly like Houston did if the Alamo City had its own Hurricane Harvey, but the damage would still be severe.
Imagine floodwaters inundating the River Walk, the Broadway corridor and neighborhoods like Mahncke Park, River Road and Tobin Hill. That’s what new simulations show.
In the three months since Harvey struck Texas, leaving destruction in its path, officials with the San Antonio River Authority have been trying to assess what could happen here if the city got similar rainfall — up to 30 to 50 inches over five days.
“We’re fortunate that we didn’t experience what happened in Houston, but we shouldn’t let that take us off our guard here in San Antonio,” SARA general manager Suzanne Scott said.

A flooding simulation of the Brackenridge Park and the Broadway corridor shows how some of San Antonio's creeks and rivers would rise if the city were hit by a Hurricane Harvey-level storm. Contractors for the San Antonio River Authority produced the images.

JUNE 24-26, 1978 (BUD)
The Central North Pacific season began with BUD, which had been a tropical storm east of longitude 140W. Remnants of BUD reached 14N 14W, as a tropical disturbance, then abruptly turned southwestward and died in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on June 26.
JUNE 26 - JULY 3, 1978 (CARLOTTA)
The ex-hurricane passed across 19N 140W, and proceeded nearly straight westward along 20N. The center of the vortex passed over the Alenuihaha Channel between the Big Island of Hawaii and the island of Maui on June 28.  During its travel across the, length of the island chain it produced heavy rainfall over much of the area north of the center, but there was no appreciable increase in windspeeds.  Rainfall amounts in many areas were as high as 6 inches (152 mm), especially over the island of Oahu.  As far as the Hawaiian public was concerned, CARLOTTA was one of the major weather producers of the season.
CARLOTTA's remnants continued to be clearly identifiable as a tropical disturbance on GOES-3 imagery as the storm proceeded westward.  It was tracked to longitude 170E, where it merged with a cold LOW aloft.  It continued to move westward to near Marcus Island (24N, 154E) on July 10.
JULY 3-11, 1978 (DANIEL)
On July 3, the same day that the remains of CARLOTTA left the Central North Pacific, ex-hurricane DANIEL entered the eastern side of the area at 16N also as a tropical disturbance.  This vortex moved westward (like that of CARLOTTA but on a slightly more southerly track) across the entire Central North Pacific between latitudes 16N and 17N. Definite dissipation of the vortex did not occur until it approached 19N 171E, on July 12.  On July 6 the cloud mass, showers, and thunderstorms accompanying the vortex encompassed nearly 180,000 square miles and was of much concern to aviation and shipping interests.  At this time the Honolulu forecast staff anticipated another episode of heavy rainfall over the entire island chain.  Windward sections of the Big Island and Maui did receive 5 to 7 inches of rain from ex-DANIEL, but rainfall over windward and mountain sections of the other islands was quite spotty and generally under the 2-inch mark.  The well-structured, massive weather pattern associated with ex- hurricane DANIEL was broken up by the "barrier effect" of the Hawaiian Islands.  Resultant divergent low-level wind flow caused the leeward portions of the Islands to remain mostly fair.
JULY 17-28, 1978 (FICO)
FICO entered the Central North Pacific at 16N, 140W, on July 17 with maximum sustained winds near 80 knots. it previously had peaked at 115 knots in the Eastern North Pacific east of the 140th meridian.  FICO proceeded along the 16th parallel to a point due south of the South Point, Hawaii, the southernmost part of the Big Island.  U.S. Air Force reconnaissance and NESS satellite imagery observed a steady increase in FICO's intensity during its travel from l40W to the position south of Soutb Point.  The RACHEL was sailing eastward north of FICO near 142W on the 18th, where she encountered 50 knot winds and swell waves of 41 feet.
Surf from the open-ocean swell generated by FICO began to rise on July 18, with some beach road flooding along the southeast coast of the Big Island when the hurricane was 500 miles to the southeast.  The high surf was a combination of east-northeasterly swell from the hurricane and strong southerly swell from a southern hemisphere storm.  By the next morning Civil Defense officials reported 30-foot (9.1 m) surf breaking well offshore with lesser 15- to 20-foot short-period surf doing ,considerable damage to beachfront homes and roads along Big Island shores.  Surf of 8 to 12 feet was observed on eastern Maui by noon of the 19th, with water over roads in that area but no damage reported.  Very short-period surf of similar heights reached southern Oahu and Kauai on the following day.  Six people aboard the 43-foot sloop DIASTOLES were rescued by a Navy torpedo boat after the sloop lost its auxiliary power off Hanalei, Hawaii and was unable to make headway in the 50-knot winds.  The 65-foot tugboat LIHUE III went aground on a reef at Kukuiula in high seas.
On July 20 the eye of the hurricane was 175 miles south southwest of South Point with maximum sustained winds of 100 knots.  The CHEVRON GENOA, which had been following FICO, measured 36-knot winds, 10-foot seas, and 16-foot swells about 100 miles to the northeast.  FICO had already begun moving northwestward maintaining 100-knot winds until he was 190 miles southwest of Kauai. Subsequently, FICO very slowly lost intensity.  At 2100 on the 21st the TOWNSEND CROMWELL fought 35 knot winds and 15-foot seas southwest of Oahu.  A strong trade wind gradient, increased by the proximity of FICO, caused gusty winds over all the islands with numerous reports of 50 knots or more, accompanied by falling trees and power outages.
FICO maintained hurricane intensity for 17 days.  It was tracked by the Honolulu and San Francisco National Weather Service forecast offices (with much support from their respective NESS units) for approximately 5,000 nautical miles.  On the 28th the MING LEADER found 55-knot winds northeast of Midway Island after FICO had turned extratropical.  Even in dying stages FICO did not want to give up.  Remnants of the storm, enmeshed in a strong cold frontal system, inflicted heavy rain and up to 40 knot winds on ships to the southeast of Cold Bay in the Aleutians on July 31.

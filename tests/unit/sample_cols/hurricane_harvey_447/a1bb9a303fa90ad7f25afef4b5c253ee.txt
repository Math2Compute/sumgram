When Matt and I walked into the Cattery on a Friday at 4:15pm, the staff greeted us even though they were closing at 5:00.  They asked us what we were looking f...or in terms of personalit
y and our lifestyle and guided us in the right direction.
We found one in the ‘teen room’ that we were drawn to, but slept on it and adopted formerly ‘Squirrel’
at Petsmart the next day.  They made the process simple, helped me pick out starter items, and told me what current litter and food they use so the transition
would be easier on now ‘Banksy’.  They provided his records and even followed up with us via email to see how things were going.  The staff are friendly and knowledgea
ble.  As for Banksy, he has been the ideal kitty for our home.  Thank you all for what you do. See More

People can say what they want but our cats are like family. Thankfully
there are shelters that will do whatever it takes to help care for our pet family while we can work to recover from the devastatio
n that has changed our lives. Shelter workers and rescuers are heroes

The Cattery Cat Shelter puts all their resources into helping cats, not into self promotion,
like other animal orgs. Donations go straight to helping cats. Duri...ng the worst natural disaster, The Cattery Cat Shelter went into immediate action to help cats, the real underdogs in rescue. Thank you Cattery Cat Shelter! See More

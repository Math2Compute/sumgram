CALALLEN - The northwest section of Corpus Christi was able to ride out Hurricane Harvey on Friday night. The storm, which made landfall at 10:07 p.m. as a Category 4 storm over Rockport, Texas, affected the Coastal Bend differently. While major structural damage has been reported near the eye of the storm, Calallen, Robstown and the Tuloso-Midway area seem to have fared pretty well.
In the aftermath of the storm, there were downed power lines, uprooted trees and plenty of debris, but for the most part, the people of the area were safe.
“We were very fortunate to have been as safe as we were,” said Doug Reiter. “Had I known that this storm would grow to a category four, I might have left.”
The city of Corpus Christi was under a voluntary evacuation, which many people chose to heed. Residents were scattered all over the state, looking for a safe place to wait out Harvey. 
“I’m glad that we left for multiple reasons, not just because of the rain and the flooding. When refineries starting doing shut downs, I knew it would be worse than what they were predicting on the news,” said Ashley Davis, Tuloso-Midway resident. Davis evacuated with her family, dog, cat and turtle. Her group went all the way to San Angelo to stay away from the storm.
Police were patrolled the Calallen area, trying to keep order and keep residents who stayed behind safe. Restaurants, gas stations and businesses remain closed, but will reopen soon and be ready to serve the very fortunate residents of Northwest Corpus Christi.

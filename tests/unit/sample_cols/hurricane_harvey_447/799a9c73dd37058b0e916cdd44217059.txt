(HURRICANE JOHN)
Hurricane JOHN was already a well developed Hurricane with 100 knot winds and about 10 days old as it entered the CPHC area of forecast responsibility to the west of 140W longitude on August 20. JOHN moved westward along 15N at a steady 12 to 15 kt rate dipping south slightly to 14N on the 22nd and 23rd while gaining strength on approaching the longitudes of the Hawaiian Islands.  When it crossed 155W, sustained winds based on Dvorak intensity analysis were estimated at 150 knots, making JOHN the most intense Hurricane of record in the Central Pacific, beating out EMILIA and GILMA, which were also of extreme intensity near 140 knots over these same waters just a few days or weeks earlier.
JOHN gave the Hawaiian Islands a wide berth passing almost 300 miles south of South Point late on the 22nd HST.  The only effects felt on the islands were strengthened trade winds and rough surf along the southeast and south facing shores also spreading to west facing shores briefly.  Heavy rains over the Ka'u and South Kona slopes of the Big Island of Hawaii caused some localized minor flooding which closed some roads temporarily.
JOHN now took aim at Johnston Island located near 17N 170W.  JOHN, fortunately, started to weaken as it approached island and passed about 15 miles to the north at 260400Z with maximum sustained winds down to 80 knots.  Passing north of Johnston Island placed the Islet in the benign semicircle of the cyclone.  The 1100 personnel on Johnston Island had been evacuated to Honolulu as a precautionary measure ahead of the approaching storm.  A remote readout anemometer on the atoll reported sustained winds between 40 and 50 knots for about 6 hours with gusts as high as 67 knots.  Damage was estimated at close to 15 million dollars.
From Johnston Island, JOHN continued west northwest while gaining renewed strength with winds reaching 115 knots at 280000Z.  JOHN, a few hours later, crossed the Dateline near 22N and was handed over to the JTWC on Guam.
During the next few days, JOHN continued to move on a northwest track, slowly weakening and reducing its forward motion.  On September 1, TropicaL Storm JOHN had almost stalled.  It then reversed course in the area near 28N 170E and curved back toward the southeast.  It completed a clockwise loop well to the southwest of Midway Island and then headed northwest once more.  Finally, on September 7, an upper trough approached from the west and the upper southwesterlies grabbed ahold of JOHN and recurvature toward the northeast was assured.  JOHN crossed back into the Central pacific at 081200Z while in an intensifying mode. JOHN crossed the Dateline near 31N and was a hurricane once more at 1800Z when passing several hundred miles northwest and north of Midway Island.  Winds were estimated at 80 knots and a well developed eye appeared on satellite imagery.
Hurricane JOHN finally was considered extratropical near 42.5N 170.3W on September 10.  The CPHC issued Advisory Number 120 at this time, denoting a life span of 30 days for Hurricane JOHN since its inception off Mexico a month earlier.  This extended life cycle likely makes JOHN the longest lived tropical cyclone on record.
This was not the first time a Tropical Cyclone reentered the Central Pacific from the Western Pacific.  Other recorded events include Tropical Storm CARMEN in 1980 and Tropical Storm SKIP in 1985.  Both of these, however, were weak cyclones.  However, JOHN left as a hurricane and returned as a hurricane once more after spending about 10 days west of the Dateline, much of this time, however, as a Tropical Storm.

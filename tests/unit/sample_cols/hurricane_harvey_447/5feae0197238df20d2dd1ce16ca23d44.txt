Citgo is giving half a million dollars to help those affected by Hurricane Harvey.
On Thursday, they provided the Coastal Bend Community Foundation $500,000 to help those affected by Harvey. They say their donation will be used to continue cleanup efforts across the Coastal Bend.
Citgo volunteers also spent Friday at the Texas Maritime Museum in Rockport passing out meals to residents and first responders. They've also spent the week providing fuel for generators needed to clean up the community and residents are very grateful. Citgo Public Affairs manager Larry Elizondo said, "They've been very nice to us, very welcoming. It's a great family feeling here. That's what we're all about. We recognize that we are given an opportunity to work in this community and because of that we need to give back and we do."

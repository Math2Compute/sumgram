The Port of Port Lavaca-Point Comfort was able to prepare for Hurricane Harvey with its facilities sustaining minor damage, according to port director Charles Hausmann.
“We cleaned everything up and tied everything down, and basically got everything prepared for big winds,” Hausmann said Friday. “We finished that up and locked the gates that Thursday afternoon. We got out of here about 7:30 p.m.”
After Harvey, the port did have electrical issues and minor damage to the warehouse, Hausmann said.
“We have a lot of lights that are down. On the rooftops, the vents for the diesel generator they blew off, but other than that, we did very well,” he said. “We are functional with those damages. We just need to get the electrical repaired, which we are hoping to finish up today. And that’s just to the liquid pier.”
As of Friday, Hausmann was waiting on the U.S. Coast Guard Captain from Corpus Christi to open the channel in order for vessels to come into the port.
“We had rough weather up until Wednesday, and they couldn’t get up here to the channel with survey boats to see what conditions we had, but they started that yesterday (Thursday), and they are supposed to get to the barge channel from the Gulf to the jetties today (Friday). We will wait and see what they will come up with and where they are at, and if we have any draft restrictions,” he said. “We are hoping this afternoon or tomorrow that we will get the channel back open to traffic.”
“Considering what it could have been, we came out in pretty good shape,” he said. “We’ve had power since Monday. I have one phone line, the main line to the office working. Still no Internet service or phone service to the tower, but we are making due with cell phones.”

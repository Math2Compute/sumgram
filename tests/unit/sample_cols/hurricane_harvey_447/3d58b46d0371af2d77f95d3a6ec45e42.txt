REFUGIO – Tropical storm force winds and surge impacts from Harvey are expected to begin Friday with landfall along mid coast Friday night. 
The National Weather Service forecast calls for a Category 1 Hurricane at landfall. Reasonable worst case for planning purposes is Cat 2. 
Peak storm surge flooding is estimated at 4-6 feet above ground level along and right of the center. There is uncertainty on exactly where this will occur.
Heavy rainfall/flooding will be primary concern as the system is expected to stall or meander across the area through weekend. Rainfall totals of 6-12 inches with isolated amounts of 20 inches possible,  mainly east of the I-37 corridor.

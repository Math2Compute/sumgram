CORPUS CHRISTI -
The Law Offices of Thomas J. Henry are also raising money for victims along the coast. Henry set up the "Thomas J. Henry Harvey Relief Fund" on his website.
Henry will match every pledge the community makes up to $100,000.
Henry said, "I know so many people in the Coastal Bend area whether it's been friends, family or people I've helped as a professional, with the disaster that we've faced and the homes that have been lost, the inability to have a place to sleep or eat, it's really incumbent for anyone who can help to pitch in during a crisis and that's why I'm doing it. I know people are in need. People are hurting and so I look forward to other people joining in and match that. So, that's why I'm doing it."
All the money will go to the Coastal Bend Community Foundation.
Thomas J. Henry also donated school supplies to children at eight Corpus Christi elementary schools.
Four thousand elementary school students from eight schools received packages of supplies that included binders, pencils, erasers and rulers.
Friday afternoon, Henry passed out supplies at J.A. Garcia Elementary.
Henry says he's done supply giveaways in San Antonio.
He wanted to do one in Corpus Christi because of the need he saw in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.

AEP Texas projects that by Wednesday at 10 p.m. crews will have restored power to 95 percent of the customers within the City of Corpus Christi, as well as the Sinton area.
Restoration dates and times are still to be determined for Rockport, Port Aransas, Fulton, Woodsboro, Port Lavaca, Lamar and Bayside. The devastation in those communities was the most extreme and will require the most amount of repairs. The damage assessment will continue in those areas, and an estimated time of restoration (ETR) will be developed when that assessment is completed.
Restoration for the majority of all other areas is expected to reach the 95 percent completion level by 10 p.m. on Saturday. Those cities include Victoria, Beeville El Campo, and Kenedy.
Please note that these ETRs are for customers whose homes or facilities can still take power. Also, the projections may be impacted by inclement weather.
Residents can track progress on the restoration effort by visiting the outage area at www.aeptexas.com . There is a real-time map featuring the most current available information. Customers also can sign up for outage alerts to receive updates via text or email.

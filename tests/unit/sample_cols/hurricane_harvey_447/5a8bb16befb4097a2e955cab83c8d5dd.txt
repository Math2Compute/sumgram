Arkema chemical plant faces explosion risk after Harvey floodwaters
1 / 82
Back to Gallery
Flood waters from Hurricane Harvey created an emergency situation that could trigger explosions at the Arkema chemical plant northeast of Houston in Crosby.
Late Monday night, the facility lost power from both its primary supply and its backup generators due to flooding. Employees moved highly volatile organic peroxides into back-up containers to keep them cool. If this class of chemical gets too hot, it can cause fires or explosions.
FLOOD CLAIMS: Damages could surpass Ike's $12.5 billion of insured losses  
"At this time, while we do not believe there is any imminent danger, the potential for a chemical reaction leading to a fire and/or explosion withing the site confines is real," Arkema spokeswoman Janet Smith said on Tuesday.
US President Donald Trump has arrived in Texas to survey the response to devastating Tropical Storm Harvey, the first major natural disaster of his White House tenure, as officials in Houston struggled to manage the record-breaking rains.   You can watch his visit live, below.   The slow-moving storm has brought catastrophic flooding to Texas, killed at least nine people, led to mass evacuations and paralyzed Houston, the fourth most-populous U.S. city. Some 30,000 people were expected to seek emergency shelter as the flooding entered its fourth day.   Officials in Harris County, where Houston is located, said reservoirs built to handle drainage water were beginning to overflow on Tuesday. They urged residents to evacuate as they released water to alleviate pressure on two dams, a move that would add to flooding along the Buffalo Bayou waterway that runs through the area.   Officials in Brazoria County, south of Houston, also called for immediate evacuations around a levee Columbia Lakes that had been breached by Harvey’s floodwaters.   Some 3,500 people already have been rescued from high waters in the Houston area with police, firefighters and National Guard troops continuing to try to locate those marooned in high waters.

The Crosby Fire Department evacuated one employee last night and the rest of the staff was evacuated Tuesday afternoon when the refrigeration in some of the back-up containers also started to fail. The French specialty chemical company produces organic peroxides at the plant.
It would be surprising if the company had not considered as scenario like this, said Sam Mannan of Texas A&M University's Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center.
Companies typically would have the ability to quench the organic peroxides in situations like this with another chemical so it's no longer dangerous.
"You'll lose the feedstock but it's safer than letting it go into runaway mode," Mannan said.
The plant at 18000 Crosby Eastgate Road, northeast of Houston, has been shut down since Friday in anticipation of the storm.
Arkema's Crosby facility is among the Houston-area sites with the highest potential for harm in an incident, according to a 2016 analysis by Texas A&M's Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center and the Houston Chronicle.
It was an organic peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, that helped land Arkema on that list.
Many homes and businesses are within two miles of the facility.
Harvey aftermath: Chemical plants imperiled
Hurricane Harvey's winds and floodwaters have created emergencies at chemical facilities across the Houston area, from an Exxon Mobil roof collapse at its massive Baytown complex to the risk of an explosion at a chemical plant northeast of Houston. We combined our Chemical Breakdown risk map, based on a facility's potential for harm, with the region's 100-year floodplains. Type in a Harris County address in the search bar above to view which sites with "potential for harm" fall within a two-mile radius of that address.

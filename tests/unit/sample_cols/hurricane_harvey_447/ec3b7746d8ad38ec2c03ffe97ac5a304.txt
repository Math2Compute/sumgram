The City of Port Aransas has compiled this list of Frequently Asked Questions in an effort to help provide residents with information in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. 
Q: When will the utilities be available?
A: Crews are continuing to work diligently on getting electrical service restored in our area. The estimated date to have electric service restored in our area is set for Friday, September 8, 2017. Gas service has been restored to homes that were not severely damaged. However, gas meters have all been turned off. Homes that do not have service will need to contact a plumber to inspect and repair broken lines. If you smell gas or need assistance relighting pilot lights, please contact the Port Aransas Police Department at 361-749-6241. To see if water and sewer service has been restored at your location, please contact the Nueces County Water Department in Port Aransas at 361-749-5201.
Q: Where do we put residential and business debris & when will it be picked up?
A: The Federal Debris Collection Contract is in place and debris has begun to be picked up around town. They will be taking brush and construction debris that you have placed at the curb. The Citizens Collection Station will ONLY be accepting brush and household trash Monday – Saturday 8am - 5pm and Sunday 10 am – 5 pm. Household trash may also be placed in your blue toter (if you still have one) or in garbage bags and placed curbside to be serviced. Any construction taken to the Collection Station will be denied.
Q: Who will remove other people’s property from my yard?
A: The City is currently working on providing guidance for the removal of large items in citizen’s yards such as boats, RV’s, and cars. It will be the property owner’s responsibility to push debris to the curbside to have it disposed of.
Q: What about my commercial trash dumpster?
A: Republic Services is having to reorganize their dumpster program for businesses. They are currently picking up all available dumpsters. To re-establish your dumpster service, please call Republic Services at 361-698-5055.
Q: What should I do with hazardous material?
A: If you discover large hazardous waste on your property such as fuel barrels or other large chemicals, please contact the General Land Office at 361-825-3100. Smaller household hazardous waste can be placed curbside in a separate pile.
Q: Is there still a curfew?
A: Yes. Effective immediately Mayor Bujan has reduced the curfew to midnight to 6:00 am.
Q: When will the curfew be lifted? 
A: The curfew will be in effect until significant electrical services can be restored and the Mayor feels enough of the general population is in place to secure their property and stay overnight.
Q: Can I sleep at my residence?
A: At this time, the City is recommending all citizens continue to follow the dark curfew from midnight to 6:00 am and leave the city to seek shelter elsewhere, due to current unsanitary conditions, dangerous electrical conditions, and potential unsafe structural issues with structures.

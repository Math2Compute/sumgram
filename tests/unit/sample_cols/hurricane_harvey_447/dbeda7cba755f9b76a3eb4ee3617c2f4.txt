RECONNAISSANCE
ZCZC MIATCDAT5 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM TROPICAL STORM HARVEY DISCUSSION NUMBER   7 NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL 5 PM EDT MON SEP 20 1999  SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM REMAINS DISORGANIZED WITH THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER LOCATED TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE MAIN AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION.  THE STORM IS PROBABLY ALSO ENTRAINING SOME DRIER AIR FROM THE NORTHWEST AS WELL.  THE GFDL MODEL CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT SOME STRENGTHENING WILL OCCUR BUT OTHER GUIDANCE...SUCH AS THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL...SUGGESTS WEAKENING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST INDICATES ONLY A SLIGHT ADDITIONAL INCREASE IN STRENGTH.  ACCORDING TO RECONNAISSANCE AND SATELLITE FIXES...THE MOVEMENT HAS BEEN A BIT ERRATIC OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS AND INITIAL MOTION IS REDUCED TO 075/5.  HOWEVER...BASED ON THE STEERING CURRENT IMPLIED BY THE LARGER-SCALE FLOW...ACCELERATION TOWARD THE EAST AND NORTHEAST IS FORECAST...SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.    SHIP REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE EXTENT OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS IS LARGER THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED...ABOUT 150 N MI OVER THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT.  THIS MEANS THAT THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING AND WATCH NEEDS TO BE EXTENDED FARTHER SOUTH.

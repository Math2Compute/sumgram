RECONNAISSANCE
ZCZC MIATCDAT5 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM TROPICAL STORM HARVEY DISCUSSION NUMBER   9 NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL 5 AM EDT TUE SEP 21 1999   RECONNAISSANCE FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT OVER THE LAST FEW HOURS INDICATE THAT HARVEY HAS TURNED TO THE SOUTHEAST.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 130/9.  HARVEY IS NOT WELL ORGANIZED...WITH MOST OF THE HEAVY RAIN AND STRONG WINDS TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  THE TURN TO THE SOUTHEAST...COUPLED WITH THE LOCATION OF THE BAD WEATHER...NECESSITATES THE ISSUANCE OF TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS FOR SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE FLORIDA KEYS.  MOST GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT HARVEY WILL TURN TO THE EAST THEN NORTHEAST AND RAPIDLY ACCELERATE IN ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING MID LATITUDE TROUGH.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED ON THE CURRENT MOTION...AND HAS SOMEWHAT LESS ACCELERATION AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD DUE TO THE MORE SOUTHERLY INITIAL TRACK.   BASED ON RECENT FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS FROM THE RECON AIRCRAFT...THE INTIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 45 KT.  GIVEN THE CURRENT ASYMMETRIC STRUCTURE OF THE CYCLONE...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS ANTICIPATED PRIOR TO LANDFALL.  HARVEY IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL WITHIN 48 HOURS.

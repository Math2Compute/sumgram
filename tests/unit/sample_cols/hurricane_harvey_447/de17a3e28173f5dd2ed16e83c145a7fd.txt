MONTHLY GLOBAL TROPICAL CYCLONE SUMMARY                                   JULY, 2007    (For general comments about the nature of these summaries, as well as   information on how to download the tabular cyclone track files, see   the Author's Note at the end of this summary.)    SPECIAL NOTE:  With the February issue I began constructing the tropical   cyclone reports in a different format with the initial section presenting   various salient characteristics of the cyclones in a very structured,   template-like format.   After a few months I began to realize that it   was requiring considerable extra time to draft this initial section, so   I polled about two dozen or so persons, soliciting their opinions   regarding the new "pro-forma" style of summaries.  Of the persons who   responded, only one seemed to favor the new style, and his was a rather   weak opinion.  The others really didn't care for it, and furthermore, I   discovered that my assistant writers, Kevin Boyle and Simon Clarke, felt   that it made writing the narrative history of the cyclones more difficult   in that they had to frequently double check to insure that they were not   duplicating information already presented.   Therefore, effective with   the July summary, I am abandoning the structured, "pro-forma" style of   report and returning to the way we've always done things.    *************************************************************************                                JULY HIGHLIGHTS     --> Two typhoons strike Japan    --> Unusual out-of-season South Indian Ocean tropical cyclone forms    --> First Eastern North Pacific hurricane of season forms    --> Former Atlantic tropical storm brings heavy rains to Newfoundland    *************************************************************************                             CYCLONE TRACK GRAPHICS       John Diebolt of Tucson, Arizona, produces track graphics of all the    tropical and subtropical systems for which I prepare a tabular track in    the companion cyclone tracks file.

EXTRA FEATURE  !!!!!!!!!!!!              HISTORY OF THE NAMING OF ATLANTIC TROPICAL CYCLONES                        PART 1 - THE FABULOUS FIFTIES    A. Introduction   ---------------       About eight years ago a query was posted to a discussion list    by a person interested in obtaining the complete sets of Atlantic    hurricane names for years prior to the establishment of the current    list of six rotating sets in 1979.   The naming of tropical cyclones   has always been a keen side interest of mine, and many years earlier I   had collected from various sources the complete alphabetical lists   of Atlantic hurricane names dating all the way back to 1950--the first   year that Atlantic tropical cyclones were systematically named from an   alphabetical set of names.         In response to the above-mentioned query, I typed all the sets of   names as I had them, along with an explanatory document, and sent them   to that particular person.     And over the years I've sent the    information to others who have expressed an interest in the old names.       So I've decided to prepare a series of monthly features detailing   the history of the naming of Atlantic tropical cyclones, plus one   feature describing the history of the naming of Eastern and Central    North Pacific cyclones.  This month's feature will cover the period   1950-1959.       Prior to 1950 Atlantic hurricanes were occasionally called by   names, the most common practice being that followed in the Antilles   of calling storms after various saints in the Roman Catholic Church   on whose day a particular hurricane may have struck a given island,   (e.g., San Ciriaco, 1899; San Felipe, 1928; San Nicolas, 1931).  But   the first year in which hurricane forecasters systematically named   tropical cyclones from a pre-determined alphabetical list was in   1950.   During that season the old World War II phonetic alphabet   was utilized for naming tropical storms and hurricanes, and also for   the two years following.     By 1952 another phonetic alphabet    had come into use--the original version of today's International   Phonetic Alphabet--and some confusion resulted when some parties   wanted to use the newer phonetic alphabet.   So in 1953 forecasters   chose to try the practice which had been in use by typhoon fore-   casters in the Western Pacific since the closing days of World   War II of naming tropical cyclones with women's names.   A set of   23 names, beginning with ALICE and ending with WALLIS, was drafted   for that year.       The tropical storm season of 1953 was active but mild--there were   no destructive hurricanes--and public reception to the idea seemed   rather favorable.  So the same list was adopted for the 1954 season   with one change--the name GAIL was replaced with GILDA, most likely   because of confusion resulting from the term 'gale' being so widely   used in both tropical and extratropical storm warnings.   In his   book "Hurricane Hunters", Ivan R. Tannehill relates that after the   destructive East Coast hurricanes of 1954, there was some public   criticism of the practice of using women's names as monikers for such   destructive storms, but after awhile the criticism died down and   forecasters continued using women's names in succeeding seasons.       With storms like CAROL, EDNA and HAZEL getting so much publicity,   forecasters had agreed to draft a new set of names for 1955.   But   before the new list had been selected, an out-of-season hurricane   appeared in the Leeward Islands on January 2, 1955, so the name ALICE   was assigned to this hurricane.   Before the regular season of 1955   began, forecasters drafted a new alphabetical set, beginning with   BRENDA and continuing all the way through the alphabet, ending with   ZELDA.   For each season through 1959 a new set of names was selected.   The only names actually assigned to tropical cyclones that were   repeated prior to 1960 were EDITH and FLORA from 1955, which were    used again in 1959.   Beginning in 1955 a restriction was put into    effect which required that hurricane names have exactly two syllables    and no more than six letters.    This restriction considerably reduced   the number of names available, especially with letters for which there   was already a scarcity of names--the letter 'X' in particular.  The    sets for 1957, 1958 and 1959 featured such unusual names as XMAY, XRAE    and XCEL.     B. Sources of Information   -------------------------       The information contained above and the lists of names themselves   came from several sources.   The World War II phonetic alphabet and   the 1953/1954 set I copied down many years ago from Ivan R. Tannehill's   book "Hurricane Hunters".  Tannehill was also the source for some of   the comments about early public reaction to the idea of naming storms   with women's names.      The names for 1955 through 1958 I found in   various magazines in libraries.   Since I wanted the names only for my   own personal interest, I didn't bother to annotate in what publication   I'd found the names.     The set for 1959 I obtained from an issue of   "Weatherwise" which I ordered many years later while copies were still   in print.      C.

(2) Hurricane Alice of 1955, named in early January, is now considered         a 1954 storm since it developed from a disturbance which has since        been traced back to late December, 1954.    *************************************************************************                                 ACTIVITY BY BASINS    ATLANTIC (ATL) - North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico    Activity for July:  1 tropical storm                             Sources of Information                           ----------------------       Most of the information presented below was obtained from the   various tropical cyclone products issued by the Tropical Prediction   Center/National Hurricane Center (TPC/NHC) in Miami, Florida:   discussions, public advisories, forecast/advisories, tropical weather   outlooks, special tropical disturbance statements, etc.    Some   additional information may have been gleaned from the monthly   summaries prepared by the hurricane specialists and available on   TPC/NHC's website.     All references to sustained winds imply a   1-minute averaging period unless otherwise noted.                       Atlantic Tropical Activity for July                     -----------------------------------       Over the period 1950-2006, the month of July has averaged 0.9 NS per   year with 0.4 reaching hurricane intensity.    Only three intense   hurricanes formed in the month during this period:  Bertha of 1996, and   Dennis and Emily of 2005.   During July, 2007, one tropical storm formed   on the final day of the month and did not reach hurricane intensity.   Tropical Storm Chantal was christened on the morning of the 31st south   of the Canadian Maritimes and became extratropical 24 hours later as it   sped toward southeastern Newfoundland.   The post-tropical stage of   Chantal brought very heavy rains and gusty winds to the island.  A report   on Tropical Storm Chantal follows.       During the first week of the month a tropical wave moved westward   across the Atlantic with an associated low-pressure area, and convective   activity increased on 3 July, leading to some prognostications that a   tropical depression might form within a couple of days.   Tropical   cyclogenesis in the east-central tropical Atlantic is very rare in early   July, but it was in that region at the same time of year that the above-   mentioned Hurricane Bertha formed in 1996.    The current disturbance,   however, began to look less organized on the 5th as environmental   conditions became less favorable and the system was dropped from NHC's   Tropical Weather Outlooks after 7 July.                              TROPICAL STORM CHANTAL                                   (TC-03)                             30 July - 4 August                 ------------------------------------------    A. Storm History   ----------------       Tropical Storm Chantal ended an almost two-month hiatus in tropical   cyclone activity in the Atlantic basin when it formed late on 30 July   south of the Canadian Maritimes.  Chantal, however, was destined to be   a short-lived system as it moved rather quickly toward Newfoundland.   Chantal's origin lay with an area of low pressure which had formed   north of the Bahamas on 28 July and with organization gradually   increasing as it tracked north-northeastward past Bermuda.       The initial TPC/NHC advisory, issued at 0300 UTC on 31 July, placed   the center of Tropical Depression 03 about 235 nm north-northwest of   Bermuda.  Satellite imagery during the morning of the 31st revealed   that the system had strengthened, and a QuikScat pass just before   1000 UTC indicated winds in the 40-45 kt range.  Hence, the depression   was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal in a special update issued at   31/1215 UTC.  The newly-christened tropical storm was located about   285 nm south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and moving quickly northeastward   at 20 kts.  The initial intensity was set to 35 kts.   Chantal reached   its peak intensity of 45 kts at 1500 UTC on 31 July while located   about 575 nm southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland.  The cyclone's   forward motion by this time had increased to 25 kts.       As the day wore on Chantal's track carried it over increasingly colder   SSTs and the storm began to rapidly transform into an extratropical   cyclone.  The final advisory from TPC/NHC, issued at 0300 UTC on   1 August, placed the center of Chantal about 295 nm southwest of Cape   Race and moving northeastward at 28 kts.  After extratropical transition,   the post-tropical storm continued to increase in intensity as it raced   northeastward.  The center of the former Chantal crossed over Newfound-   land's Avalon Peninsula during the morning of 1 August, thence continuing   northeastward into the North Atlantic.  Based on OPC's warnings, the   extratropical storm reached an intensity of 60 kts/965 mb at 03/0000   UTC near 59N/32W.  Thereafter, the system began to weaken but was still   a 974-mb LOW to the south of Iceland near 60N/19W at 0600 UTC on the   4th of August.       A very detailed narrative history of Tropical Storm Chantal may be   found at the following link:
B. Storm Effects in Canada   --------------------------       Dr. Chris Fogarty, a forecaster at the Canadian Hurricane Centre in   Halifax, Nova Scotia, has kindly sent me some information about the   effects of Chantal in Canada which forms the basis for this section.

I'm including it here for the benefit of interested   persons, but I am not going to re-work the track for Chantal which has   already been sent out in the companion cyclone tracks file which was   based upon TPC/NHC and OPC warnings.

Impacts in Newfoundland   --------------------------       After losing its tropical characteristics by 0600 UTC on 1 August,   the center of Post-tropical Chantal moved quickly toward Newfoundland's   Avalon Peninsula with the center arriving during the mid-morning that   day.  Conditions were wet and windy along the shores of Avalon with most   of the heavy rain falling between midnight and midday over the Avalon   and Burin Peninsulas.  Western portions of the Avalon Peninsula received   the heaviest falls (from 100 to 200 mm).  The highest reported one-hour   falls were 43 mm at St. John's West and 49 mm at Mt. Pearl between   6:30 and 7:30 am on 01 August when the center of the storm was about   five hours away from crossing the Peninsula.  Winds were not particularly   strong with Chantal, and were confined to the southern Avalon Peninsula,   with coastal gusts near 43 kts.  An official peak gust of 37 kts was   recorded at Cape Race, and an unofficial gust of 48 kts was reported   at Cape Pine on the southern Avalon Peninsula.       The very heavy rains caused rivers and streams to swell quickly,   washing out several roads and bridges and isolating some communities from   the primary road network.  Such instances were common over the western   part of the Avalon where the heaviest rainfall occurred.  States of   emergency were declared for some towns including Placentia and South   River.  There were many instances of water inundating low-lying areas,   particularly in St. John's.  Storm drains were overwhelmed, and water   was forced through drain covers on some streets.  The flooding was   severe enough to cause some structural damage to buildings.       For the Burin and Avalon Peninsulas, the normal July and August total   rainfall is about 200 mm.  This essentially means that much of the   affected region received one to two months worth of summer rainfall in   the span of about 12 hours.  Argentia reported 116 mm of rain in the   24 hours ending at 3:30 am (local time) 02 August.

All references to   sustained winds imply a 1-minute averaging period unless otherwise   noted.                   Northeast Pacific Tropical Activity for July                 --------------------------------------------       Tropical activity for the month of July in the Northeast Pacific basin   was somewhat below normal during 2007.  Over the period 1971-2006, the   month of July has produced an annual average of 3.7 NS, 1.9 H, and 1.1   IH.  During July, 2007, there were two NS with one reaching hurricane   intensity, and no intense hurricanes.   Tropical Storm Cosme formed far   to the southwest of Baja California on 15 July and briefly reached   minimal hurricane intensity the next day before beginning to weaken.   The residual depression moved westward and entered CPHC's area of warning   responsibility, moving south of Hawaii before finally dissipating near   Johnston Island.   Tropical Storm Dalila formed far to the south of the   Gulf of California on the 23rd and pursued a general northwesterly   trajectory roughly parallel to the Mexican coastline.  The cyclone peaked   at 50 kts on the 24th before encountering colder SSTs and weakening.   Short reports follow on both Cosme and Dalila.       Three other tropical depressions formed during the month.  Tropical   Depression 04E was spawned by a tropical wave that emerged from the   coast of Africa on 23 June and reached the Pacific on 3 July.  The   associated convection increased on 6 July and began to show signs of   organization the next day.  A depression formed late on 9 July about   615 nm southwest of the southern tip of Baja California.  A combination   of southwesterly vertical shear and decreasing SSTs along the track   prevented additional strengthening as the system tracked northwestward.   TD-04E turned westward late on 10 July and weakened to a non-convective   remnant LOW early the next day about 765 nm west-southwest of the tip   of Baja California.       Tropical Depression 05E developed from a tropical wave that moved   off the west coast of Africa on 21 June and entered the Eastern North   Pacific on 10 July.  Disorganized convection associated with the wave   increased on 11 July.  The wave moved westward and gradually became   better organized over the next couple of days, and a depression formed   at 1200 UTC 14 July about 200 nm south-southwest of the southern tip    of Baja California.    Under the influence of vertical shear, the    depression was unable to strengthen further.  The system continued    west-northwestward on 15 July, and cooler waters and a more stable    airmass resulted in its degenerating into a remnant LOW by 0000 UTC    on 16 July.    (NOTE: The information in the above two paragraphs was pretty much   taken verbatim from the TPC/NHC monthly summary for July.  It seems   rather unusual that a tropical wave which departed the coast of Africa   on 23 June reached the Eastern Pacific on 3 July, whereas one which   exited Africa two days earlier did not enter the Pacific until 10 July.   I also checked the official reports on the two depressions which have   already been made available online on NHC's website, and the same dates   are given.  I wrote the author of one of the reports inquiring about   the matter but have not yet received a reply.  If I should receive an   answer, I will include it in next month's summary.)       Tropical Depression 08E formed on 31 July far to the southwest of   Baja California.  The system gradually intensified and became Tropical   Storm Erick on 1 August.  The report on Erick will be contained in the   August summary.    NOTE: The official TPC/NHC storm reports are already available online   for all the July systems.

HURRICANE COSME                                   (TC-06E)                                 14 - 23 July                     -----------------------------------       The Northeastern Pacific basin's first hurricane of 2007 originated   from a tropical wave which was tracked with difficulty across the   Atlantic and Caribbean Sea due to a lack of associated convection.  The   wave entered the Eastern North Pacific around 8 July and began to show   signs of organization on the 10th.  The system continued westward and   had organized into Tropical Depression 06E by 14 July when located about   1175 nm southwest of Cabo San Lucas on the southern tip of the Baja   California Peninsula.   TD-06E was a very large circulation which   initially moved slowly northwestward in response to a weakness in the   ridge to the north.   The system gradually strengthened and was upgraded   to Tropical Storm Cosme at 1800 UTC on 15 July while located roughly   1200 nm southwest of Cabo San Lucas.   The atmospheric environment was   conducive for further strengthening, and with a warm ocean, Cosme   reached hurricane intensity at 16/1800 UTC while centered approximately   1300 nm west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, or about 1400 nm east of Hilo,   Hawaii.       By early on the 17th Cosme had turned to a westerly track in response   to a strengthening ridge to the north.  However, the storm had also   entered into an environment of moderate easterly shear with SSTs having   dropped to around 25 C.  Consequently, Cosme weakened rapidly with the   MSW dropping from 65 kts to 35 kts in only 18 hours.  The cyclone   continued to weaken as it moved westward and was downgraded to a tropical   depression at 18/1800 UTC just prior to crossing 140W into the Central   North Pacific region at a point approximately 875 nm east-southeast of   Hilo.   The former minimal hurricane was only a swirl of low clouds   that was completely devoid of deep convection as it entered the CPHC   area of warning responsibility.  The depression continued moving toward   the west-northwest at around 13-17 kts during the next few days within   a hostile environment which did not allow it to regain tropical storm   intensity.  Cosme passed well to the south of the Big Island on the   21st.  Intermittent flare-ups of deep convection permitted the system   to maintain winds of about 30 kts for several days as it continued   westward across the Central North Pacific.  Buoy 51002 reported seas   of 18 feet and an 8.5-min avg wind of 28 kts, gusting to 35 kts, on   21 July as the center of Cosme passed 56 nm to the south.  By the 22nd   the depression finally succumbed to two days of very strong vertical   shear, and CPHC issued the final advisory at 23/0300 UTC, locating the   dissipating center just to the southeast of Johnston Island.       Even though Tropical Depression Cosme passed about 200 nm south of   Hilo, it transported a large area of moisture far to the north.  The   interaction of this moisture brought much needed rain to parts of the   Big Island.  Rainfall totals for the 48-hour period starting on the   morning of 20 July ranged from 75 to 180 mm in the Hilo and Puna   Districts, while totals from 25 to 75 mm were measured in the Kau   District.  Gusty easterly winds also caused some tree limbs and small   trees to fall, resulting in temporary power outages to some areas of   the eastern Big Island.  However, no significant damage or injuries   were reported.    (Report written by Gary Padgett)                              TROPICAL STORM DALILA                                  (TC-07E)                                22 - 27 July                 -----------------------------------------       Tropical Storm Dalila developed from a tropical wave which entered   the Eastern North Pacific basin on 17 July.  The wave spawned a broad   low-pressure area south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on 19 July, which   subsequently moved slowly westward.  Associated convective activity   increased on 21 July, and by early on 22 July the system had acquired   enough organization to be classified as a tropical depression.  At   0000 UTC on 22 July TD-07E was located about 400 nm south of Manzanillo,   Mexico, with an initial intensity of 25 kts.  Northeasterly shear   initially inhibited significant strengthening; however, by 0600 UTC   on 23 July the system had reached tropical storm intensity about 600 nm   south-southwest of Mazatlan and was named Dalila.   A ridge over   northern Mexico steered Dalila northwestward during the next few days   while it slowly strengthened.       Tropical Storm Dalila reached a peak intensity of 50 kts at 1800 UTC   on 24 July while centered about 50 nm southeast of Socorro Island, or   approximately 350 nm south of Cabo San Lucas.  After passing very near   Socorro, Dalila encountered cooler waters and began to weaken.  On the   26th, while located about 210 nm southwest of the southern tip of Baja   California, the cyclone turned west-northwestward and weakened to a   tropical depression the next day.  By later on the 27th Dalila had   degenerated into a remnant LOW and NHC issued the final advisory on   the system at 27/1500 UTC, locating the center about 450 nm west of   Cabo San Lucas.  The remnant LOW subsequently moved west-northwestward   during the next few days and dissipated on 30 July.       No damage or casualties are known to have resulted from Tropical   Storm Dalila.

S. Air Force and   Navy (JTWC), located at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.   In the companion   tropical cyclone tracks file, I normally annotate track coordinates   from some of the various Asian warning centers when their center   positions differ from JTWC's by usually 40-50 nm or more.   All   references to sustained winds imply a 1-minute averaging period   unless otherwise noted.       Michael V. Padua of Naga City in the Philippines, owner of the   Typhoon 2000 website, normally sends me cyclone tracks based upon   warnings issued by the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the   Philippines' Atmospheric, Geophysical & Astronomical Services   Administration (PAGASA).  A very special thanks to Michael for the   assistance he so reliably provides.          In the title line for each storm I have referenced all the cyclone   names/numbers I have available:   JTWC's depression number, the    JMA-assigned name (if any), JMA's tropical storm numeric designator,   and PAGASA's name for systems forming in or passing through their   area of warning responsibility.                   Northwest Pacific Tropical Activity for July                 --------------------------------------------       Three named tropical cyclones sprang to life in the Northwest Pacific   basin during July after a completely quiet June.  Short-lived Tropical   Storm Toraji formed near Hainan Island and within about 24 hours had   crossed the Gulf of Tonkin and moved into Vietnam.   Typhoon Man-yi   (known in the Philippines as Bebeng) formed early in the second week   of July very deep in the tropics to the south of Guam.  Initially   moving west-northwestward, Man-yi passed roughly 175 nm north of Yap   early on 10 July as it was nearing typhoon intensity.  The storm later   passed over Okinawa on 13 July near its peak intensity.  (Man-yi was   twice upgraded to super typhoon status by JTWC, but there is some doubt   as to whether the cyclone ever reached 130 kts.)  The storm later struck   the extreme southern portions of the Japanese islands of Kyushu and   Shikoku and brushed southern Honshu as it was weakening.  Near the end   of the month Typhoon Usagi formed east of the northern Mariana Islands   and passed through the island chain as it was reaching typhoon intensity.   Usagi recurved toward southwestern Japan, becoming a respectable 120-kt   typhoon (per JTWC's analysis).  After weakening some, the cyclone crossed   over eastern Kyushu and extreme western Honshu before becoming extra-   tropical in the Sea of Japan.   Reports, authored by Kevin Boyle, follow   on the three named cyclones.       Three other systems were designated tropical depressions by JMA only.   One was in progress at the beginning of the month, and a discussion of   this system may be found in the introduction to the Northwest Pacific   basin in the June summary.    On 25 July the remnants of ex-Tropical   Depression Cosme from the Central North Pacific crossed the Dateline,   and the JMA High Seas Bulletin at 25/0000 UTC referenced the LOW as a   weak tropical depression near 16N/180E.  However, in the next bulletin   the system was listed as only a low-pressure area.   The JMA High Seas   bulletin for 0000 UTC 27 July mentioned a weak tropical depression near   25N/135E, moving north at 10 kts.  This was the only reference to this   system, and the latitude suggests it was probably more subtropical in    nature than purely tropical.  No reference to this system was made in    any STWO from JTWC.                              TROPICAL STORM TORAJI                             (TC-03W / TS 0703)                                 3 - 6 July                 -----------------------------------------    Toraji: contributed by DPR (North) Korea, is the name of a beautiful            flower which blooms unnoticed, usually found deep in the            mountains of Korea, and which is useful as food and medicine    A. Synoptic History   -------------------       Tropical Storm Toraji began as a persistent area of convection   located approximately 135 nm southeast of Hainan, and was initially   mentioned in JTWC's STWO at 0100 UTC 3 July.  Animated multi-spectral    satellite imagery showed scattered deep convection south of a partially   exposed LLCC.  Upper-level shear was assessed as weak to moderate with   fair equatorward outflow.  Despite its close proximity to land, the    disturbance gradually consolidated, and following a 24-hour pressure    fall of over 5 hPa over Hainan, JTWC issued a TCFA at 04/0130 UTC.  At    this time, the disturbance was located approximately 65 nm east-southeast   of Hainan.  (JMA had first classified the system as a tropical depression   near 15N/112W at 0000 UTC 3 July.)       The first warning at 04/0600 UTC upgraded the disturbance to a 35-kt   tropical storm and positioned the centre approximately 50 nm southeast    of Hainan.  Upon making landfall in Hainan Dao, Tropical Storm 03W was    downgraded to a tropical depression at 04/1200 UTC, and then re-instated   as a 35-kt tropical storm six hours later as it was emerging back over    water.  JMA upgraded the depression to tropical storm status and   assigned the name Toraji at 05/0000 UTC, also estimating the MSW at   35 kts (10-min avg).  Tropical Storm Toraji maintained this intensity    as it tracked northwestward and north-northwestward along the western    boundary of a subtropical ridge.  The system crossed the Gulf of Tonkin    and made landfall in northeastern Vietnam before 1200 UTC on 5 July.    JTWC issued the final warning at 05/1200 UTC, downgrading Toraji to a   tropical depression, located approximately 155 km east-northeast of    Hanoi.  The storm continued west-northwestwards over land and had    dissipated by 0000 UTC 6 July.     B. Meteorological data   ----------------------       Weak surface wind reports suggest that Tropical Storm Toraji had no    significant impact in either Hainan or Vietnam.          C. Damage and casualties   ------------------------       There were no reports of damage or casualties associated with Tropical   Storm Toraji.   The Wikipedia report notes that Guangxi Province    evacuated 147,000 persons in response to the storm.       (Report written by Kevin Boyle)                                    TYPHOON MAN-YI                         (TC-04W / TY 0407 / BEBENG)                                7 - 20 July               -----------------------------------------------    Man-yi: contributed by Hong Kong, was originally the name of a strait.           With the construction of a dam, that part of the sea has become           a reservoir.    A. Synoptic History   -------------------       Typhoon Man-yi formed within a monsoon trough which lay from    the Philippines southeastward through Micronesia to around 160E. It was   first mentioned as a suspect area in JTWC's STWO at 1600 UTC 5 July    when satellite imagery indicated scattered convection developing around   a partially-exposed LLCC.  A QuikScat pass indicated 10-15 kt winds south   of this weak centre.  Upper-level analysis indicated moderate wind shear   and favourable divergence aloft.  The disturbance gradually organized    while drifting westwards.  A TCFA was issued at 07/0200 UTC with    strengthening convective bands to the south and to the northwest of the    centre.  The first warning on Tropical Depression 04W was issued at    07/1200 UTC with the centre located approximately 500 nm south-southeast   of Guam.  TD-04W progressed quickly to a 35-kt tropical storm six hours   later.  However, JMA did not upgrade the depression to tropical storm   status and assign the name Man-yi until 1800 UTC 8 July.  Even though   JMA uses a 10-min avg for their MSW estimates, they equate a Dvorak   rating of T2.5 to 35 kts, the same as the U. S. warning agencies.  The   center fix positions between JTWC and JMA diverged fairly significantly   on 7 and 8 July, so this may have been one factor in the differing   intensity estimates.       Tropical Storm Man-yi drifted steadily on a west-northwest to westerly   course for several days along the southern flank of a mid-level    subtropical ridge.  Slow intensification ensued and the storm finally    reached typhoon strength at 0600 UTC 10 July while located approximately   200 nm north of Yap.  Man-yi continued to strengthen and an eye began    appearing early on 11 July as the storm entered PAGASA's AOR (where it   was known locally as Bebeng).  Turning northwestward, then to the   north-northwest, Man-yi intensified at a more rapid pace and reached its   peak intensity of 135 kts at 12/1800 UTC while located about 75 nm south   of Naha, Okinawa.  The typhoon subsequently passed northwards over    Okinawa shortly after 13/0000 UTC.  After rounding the subtropical ridge   and recurving northeastwards,  Man-yi began to weaken on 13 July.     Initially making landfall in Kagoshima, Kyushu, late on 13 July with    winds of about 85 kts, Man-yi then scraped along much of the southern    coastline of Japan.   JTWC downgraded Man-yi to tropical storm intensity   at 14/1800 UTC before issuing the final warning twelve hours later, the   centre being then located about 80 nm south-southeast of Tokyo.  However,   JMA maintained Man-yi as a tropical storm for another 36 hours, finally   classifying the system as a 40-kt extratropical gale at 17/0000 UTC while   located far to the east of Japan near 37N/153E.  The gale continued   moving east-northeastward at a gradually slowing pace, and had weakened   to a 30-kt LOW near 44N/168E by 20/0600 UTC.         Man-yi was a larger than average system.  For example, the wind    distribution in the JTWC 13/0600 UTC warning stated that sustained    typhoon-force winds extended up to 100 nm over the eastern semicircle    and the radius of gale-force winds extended over 200 nm also over the    same semicircle.      EDITOR'S NOTE: As noted in the narrative above, JTWC's peak estimated   intensity for Man-yi was 135 kts at 12/1800 UTC.  However, there is   considerable evidence that this is an overestimation of the cyclone's   intensity; hence, I did not label Man-yi as a super typhoon in the   title line.  Dr. Karl Hoarau performed a Dvorak analysis of Typhoon   Man-yi during the portion of the storm's history, and feels very   strongly that the storm's intensity at 12/1800 UTC was around 115 kts,   and near 100 kts when the centre was nearest Okinawa.  Karl's peak    intensity of 125 kts was reached at 0000 and 0600 UTC on the 12th.

Observations   ---------------       Gary forwarded some observations that he received from Derrick    Herndon.  (A special thanks to Derrick for sending the information.)      "Naha recorded a pressure of 939 mb when the center passed about    15 miles to the west at 0100 UTC on the 13th.   Winds at the time were    sustained at 35 kts (10-minute), putting the CP at about 930 mb.     Strongest winds at Naha were 220@62G82 kts at 0200 UTC as the station    experienced the second passage of the eyewall.  These winds seem rather    weak given the MSLP and robustness of the eyewall on radar, even    accounting for the different time averaging.  Kadena's strongest winds    were 200@66 kts at 0200 UTC with a gust to 91 kts at 0300 UTC on the    13th."       According to Karl Hoarau, Naha recorded a peak gust of 109 kts from   the ESE at 12/2314 UTC just before eye passage.  (Karl's e-mail dated   the observation on 13 July, which would be true locally for Okinawa,   but the UTC date must obviously have been 12 July.)       For the landfall in mainland Japan:    "Man-yi made a direct hit on Kanoya AFB in southern Kyushu where winds    dropped off to 7 kts with 953 mb at 0500 UTC on the 14th.  Strongest    winds there were 270@41G64 kts at an elevation of 68 meters.    Aburatsu   (elevation 15 meters), which was in a better location to experience    stronger winds, had 200@63 kts 10-minute wind at 0600Z (no gusts    reported) with a pressure of 957 mb.   Also Tanegeshima Island to the    south had a sustained wind of 61 kts.  Farther upstream Murotomisaki    reported sustained winds of 140@64 kts at an elevation of 164 meters at    1200Z on the 14th.  The center passed close to Miyakejima on the 15th at   0500 UTC when the stationed reported 977 mb.  Strongest winds I could    find were to the south at Hachijojima where the station recorded winds    of 32G55 kts at 0000 UTC on the 15th."     C.

However, the regular report (with additional links)   may be accessed at the following URL:
D. Damage and Casualties   ------------------------       According to the Wikipedia report, three people died and six were   reported missing when a ship capsized 375 miles northwest of Guam.  Also,   the storm resulted in 37 injuries and widespread power cuts on Okinawa.    A separate report by the BBC indicated that Man-yi was responsible for    3 deaths and 70 injuries on the southern Japanese islands of Kyushu and    Shikoku.  Train and air services were disrupted and highways closed.    More than 300,000 people were evacuated.

Synoptic History   -------------------       The tropical disturbance that spawned Usagi was first mentioned as a   suspect area in JTWC's regular STWO at 0600 UTC 27 July when it was    located approximately 570 nm east-northeast of Saipan.  Animated multi-   spectral imagery indicated a rapidly consolidating LLCC with flaring deep   convection.  Upper-level analysis indicated low vertical wind shear and    good equatorward outflow, aided by a 200-mb anticyclone just to the    north.  The development potential was set at 'fair'.   Moving south-   westward, the disturbance continued to organize and JTWC issued a TCFA at   27/1330 UTC.  The first warning on Tropical Depression 05W was issued at   28/1200 UTC, followed by an upgrade to tropical storm intensity six hours   later with the centre located approximately 235 nm northeast of Saipan,   moving west at 12 kts.  JMA raised their 10-min avg MSW to 35 kts at    29/0600 UTC and dubbed the system Usagi.       Drifting westwards, Tropical Storm Usagi quickly intensified, and    after passing through the northern Marianas, was upgraded to a 65-kt    typhoon at 1800 UTC 29 July.   (JMA's intensity, however, was only 45 kts   at the time, and it was 36 hours before that agency upgraded Usagi to    typhoon status.)  Typhoon Usagi continued to strengthen over the next two   days while turning onto a northwesterly course along the southwestern    periphery of a low to mid-level subtropical ridge.  The storm reached its   peak intensity of 120 kts at 01/0000 UTC while located approximately   250 nm west of Iwo Jima.   (JMA's peak estimated 10-min avg MSW was   90 kts.)   Steady weakening began later on 1 August as Usagi turned    north-northwestward towards a break in the subtropical ridge and into    a more hostile environment.  The system made landfall in Kyushu, Japan,   at around 02/1200 UTC with a MSW of 75 kts.  After tracking northward   across Kyushu, Usagi recurved northeastward into the Sea of Japan and   across northern Honshu before transforming into an extratropical LOW    on 4 August.  Usagi's remnants intensified into a 50-kt extratropical   storm on 5 August as the system continued east-northeastward across   the North Pacific.  The storm began to weaken on 6 August as it slowed   and turned to the north.  By 1200 UTC on the 7th it had weakened to a   30-kt LOW in the Bering Sea east of the Kamchatka Peninsula.       At its peak Usagi was an average-sized typhoon with a 60-nm radius   of typhoon-force winds, and with gales covering a zone approximately   275 nm in diameter.  The minimum CP estimated by JMA was 945 hPa.     B. Observations   ---------------       Derrick Herndon passed along the following observations:    "The center passed about 25 miles north of Nyutabaru AFB which reported   a pressure of 968 mb with winds 290@31G44 kts on August 2nd at 0700Z.     The strongest winds from this station were 030@35G72 kts when the center   was to the east at 0500Z.  The station is near the coast but at 82 meters   elevation.  The pressure suggests a MSLP around 962 mb.  Seto, located    in the straits between Shikoku and Kyushu Islands was better located to    experience the strongest winds and had sustained winds 120@60 kts;    however, this station is also elevated, being at 143 meters.

D. Damage and Casualties   ------------------------       According to news reports, Usagi left 18 people injured in Kyushu.    Trees were felled, rivers were flooded, and thousands of homes were left   without power.  Bullet trains from Honshu were suspended and a number    of flights were cancelled.  There were no reports of casualties.

S. Air Force and   Navy (JTWC), located at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.   Occasionally some   information may be gleaned from the daily tropical weather outlooks   and other bulletins issued by the Indian Meteorological Department   (IMD), which is the World Meteorological Organization's Regional   Specialised Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for the basin.        The reported maximum sustained winds (MSW) are based on a 1-minute   averaging period, which is used by all U. S. civilian and military   weather services for tropical cyclone warnings.     For synoptic   observations in the North Indian Ocean region, both 10-minute and   3-minute average winds are employed, but IMD makes no attempt to   modify the Dvorak scale for estimating tropical cyclone intensity;   hence, a 1-minute average MSW is implied.  In the North Indian Ocean   basin JTWC usually does not initiate warnings until a system has   become well-organized and likely to attain tropical storm status   within 48 hours.                  North Indian Ocean Tropical Activity for July                ---------------------------------------------       A system which was likely more of a monsoon depression began to take   shape in the northern Bay of Bengal in early July.  Early on 4 July the   IMD upgraded the low-pressure area to depression status, fixing the   center at 04/0300 UTC over the Bangladesh coast about 150 km southeast   of Kolkata (Calcutta).    The system moved in a west-northwesterly   direction and 24 hours later lay over Gangetic West Bengal about 50 km   north of Kolkata.  Even though inland, the system strengthened slightly   and had become a deep depression (30 kts) by 05/1200 UTC while remaining   practically stationary.  The deep depression subsequently began to move   westward and by 0300 UTC on 6 July was close to Bankura.  By early on   the 7th it had weakened back to depression status (25 kts) over North   Chhattisgarh, close to Ambikapur.  The last reference by IMD available   to the author was at 0300 UTC on 8 July with the slowly weakening   system located over eastern Madhya Pradesh about 50 km southeast of   Sagar.  According to the online Wikipedia report, the system was down-   graded to a low-pressure area later on the 8th, but experienced a brief   re-intensification to depression status the next day near Shivpuri in   northwestern Madhya Pradesh.  However, it weakened again later that day   and the IMD issued its final bulletin.       JTWC mentioned the system in a STWO issued at 0900 UTC on 4 July, but   since the center of circulation was already inland in southwestern   Bangladesh, it was not considered a candidate for tropical cyclone   development.  The Wikipedia report states that the system caused heavy   rains in the Calcutta area with 16 casualties.  Almost 20% of the   cumulative rainfall for the entire monsoon season fell in three days.       Since the system was almost entirely an over land depression, I did   not prepare a track for it in the July cyclone tracks file.  However,   I am including one below based on the few IMD bulletins I have available.

The second of these, designated as   TC-01S by JTWC, formed in the extreme eastern portion of the basin and   eventually moved east of 90E into the AOR of BoM Perth.  While not   treated as a tropical cyclone operationally by the Perth TCWC, during a   post-storm analysis the determination was made, based primarily upon   QuikScat data, that the system had in fact reached tropical cyclone   (i.e., tropical storm) intensity, and it is now officially classified as    an unnamed tropical cyclone.  A report on TC-01S follows.       On 21 July, about a week prior to the formation of TC-01S, an area of   convection appeared approximately 110 nm east-northeast of Diego Garcia   and persisted.  Animated EIR and AMSU data revealed a developing LLCC.   The system was located within a region of moderate vertical wind shear   with weak divergence aloft.  The next day the center was fully-exposed,   but Diego Garcia had reported 24-hour pressure falls of almost 5 mb, and   a QuikScat pass at 22/0142 UTC had indicated strong gradient winds on   the southern periphery of the disturbance with strong convergence over   the southwestern quadrant; therefore, JTWC upped the potential for    development to 'fair' at 22/1030 UTC.  Based on satellite fix bulletins    from JTWC, the peak winds during this phase were likely around 25 kts    (1-min avg).  The system began to drift in a south-southwesterly    direction and gradually became better organized.   By 1800 UTC on 23 July   the system was located approximately 95 nm south of Diego Garcia and the   LLCC was partially-exposed.  However, by late on the 24th the system had   weakened and was no longer considered suspect for tropical cyclone    development.       Dvorak ratings from JTWC reached T2.0/2.0 at 22/1130 UTC, and peaked   at T2.5/2.5 at 22/1730 UTC, after which they began to decline.  However,   Dvorak estimates from SAB were at T2.5/2.5 from 22/1430 through 23/0830   UTC.  Based on consistent Dvorak T-numbers of T2.0 or higher from two   independent agencies, it is very likely that peak 1-min avg winds were   around 30 kts, and possibly could have reached 35 kts on the 22nd and   23rd.   The track for this system (NRL Invest 90S) which I prepared for   the companion cyclone tracks file was based completely on satellite   fix bulletins issued by JTWC and SAB.  Since neither MFR nor JTWC issued   warnings on this system, I refrained from assigning a MSW value of    35 kts, but winds to tropical storm-strength were possible considering   the intensity estimates from SAB and JTWC.                                 TROPICAL CYCLONE                                  (TC-01S)                                27 - 31 July                    ------------------------------------       A tropical LOW formed in the Southwest Indian Ocean just east of 90E   in late July and intensified into a minimal tropical cyclone, as   analyzed by both JTWC and BoM Perth.   Development to tropical depression   status and to near tropical storm intensity occurred in the AOR of Meteo   France La Reunion, but that agency did not consider it well-organized   enough to initiate warnings until it was on the verge of moving into   Perth's AOR.  Although the latter agency did not name the system in real   time, it was upgraded to tropical cyclone status during a post-storm   review, mainly on the basis of QuikScat data.       A low formed within the near-equatorial trough on 26 July.  QuikScat   data showed a broad trough near 4S/86E at 26/0100 UTC, and then a tighter   circulation with a well-defined LLCC at 26/1241 UTC.    An area of   associated convection developed on 27 July approximately 810 nm east   of Diego Garcia, or a like distance northwest of the Cocos Islands.   Animated infrared imagery, a 27/1419 UTC SSMI microwave image, and a   27/1215 UTC QuikScat pass revealed loosely-organized convective banding   surrounding the LLCC.  The system was located in a region of good   poleward outflow but with moderate vertical shear.   Based on a JTWC   satellite fix bulletin, winds were likely about 25 kts (1-min avg).   AMSU data a few hours later revealed improved banding so the potential   for development was upgraded to 'fair' at 27/2230 UTC.  As the system   drifted generally southeastward it continued to exhibit increased   organization, so JTWC issued a TCFA at 28/0230.       The system underwent a temporary weakening later on the 28th as the   center became exposed, but a second TCFA was issued at 29/0130 UTC.   The first JTWC warning on TC-01S was issued at 1800 UTC on 29 July with   the center located approximately 400 nm west-northwest of Cocos Island,   tracking south-southeastward at 15 kts.  The system by now was already   west of 90E, and BoM Perth issued a gale warning at 30/0400 UTC,   estimating the maximum 10-min avg winds at 30 kts but forecast to   increase to gale force.  JTWC's second and final warning was issued   at 30/0600 UTC, and while the MSW was still held at 35 kts, vertical   shear had increased and the system was forecast to quickly dissipate.   TC-01S reached its westernmost point around 1200 UTC 30 July when it   was located about 350 nm south of the Cocos Islands.  Afterward the   system began to drift west-northwestward and weaken.  The final Perth   warning at 31/0600 UTC placed the LOW very near 90E about 450 nm south-   southwest of Cocos.       The following information is taken from a preliminary report on the   storm prepared by BoM Perth and sent to the author by Joe Courtney. (A   special thanks to Joe for sending the report.)  As noted above, the   Perth TCWC upgraded the LOW to tropical cyclone status based primarily   on QuikScat data instead of conventional Dvorak estimates.  Cyclone   intensity is estimated to have been reached at 29/0600 UTC and continuing   through 30/0600 UTC.  Dvorak estimates during this time ranged from T2.5    to T3.0.  Operationally, the lower value was chosen, but upon re-analysis   the higher value was utilized, being biased from supporting QuikScat   images at 29/1100 and 29/2310 UTC.  The former image captured only the   eastern part of the system, but some 30-40 kt wind flags showed up on   the eastern flank, which suggests that gales likely surrounded at least   half the LLCC.  Ambiguity plots and NRCS wind speed plots from the latter   image also suggest that gales surrounded the center.  Also, an ASCAT   image from 29/1500 UTC depicted 30-40 kt winds around the center.       The LOW formed over warmer-than-normal waters in excess of 28 C, but   as the system moved south of 10S is encountered SSTs of less than 27 C,   and during the 30th, when it reached 12S, the SSTs were estimated at   less than 25 C.

TC-01S is only the second tropical cyclone on record to have formed   during July in the Western Australian Region.  The other was Tropical   Cyclone Lindsay, which occurred in the same general region on 10-11 July   1996 and was at minimal tropical cyclone intensity for only 21 hours.       The BoM report concludes with the following very true and relevant   statement:  "It is arguable that without QuikScat imagery that this   system would not have been classified as a tropical cyclone going by   imagery alone.  This type of system may not be represented in the   historical database, which is significant when making conclusions about   trends in the frequency of tropical cyclones."

Additional tropical satellite imagery, along with looping ability for   composite microwave imagery for the Western Hemisphere north of the   equator, can be found at:    (1) For the Eastern North Pacific:
(2) For the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea:
(4) Cyclone Tracking Information   --------------------------------       There is a U. S. Navy site that tracks tropical cyclones at 6-hourly    intervals which often includes pre and post-advisory positions.  The    link to the site is:
These tracks are often updated as further analysis occurs and may be   considered as sort of a working "best track".       Steve Young has compiled many of these tracks onto a single webpage   which is very user-friendly:
I'm sure there are other sites with available imagery available, and   as I learn of them, I will add the links to this list.    *************************************************************************                                 EXTRA FEATURE       In order to shorten the amount of typing in preparing the narrative   material, I have been in the habit of freely using abbreviations and   acronyms.   I have tried to define most of these with the first usage   in a given summary, but I may have missed one now and then.  Most of   these are probably understood by a majority of readers but perhaps a   few aren't clear to some.  To remedy this I developed a Glossary of   Abbreviations and Acronyms which I first included in the August, 1998   summary.  I don't normally include the Glossary in most months in   order to help keep them from being too long.  If anyone would like to   receive a copy of the Glossary, please e-mail me and I'll be happy   to send them a copy.    *************************************************************************    AUTHOR'S NOTE:  This summary should be considered a very preliminary    overview of the tropical cyclones that occur in each month. The cyclone   tracks (provided separately) will generally be based upon operational   warnings issued by the various tropical cyclone warning centers.  The   information contained therein may differ somewhat from the tracking and   intensity information obtained from a "best-track" file which is based   on a detailed post-seasonal analysis of all available data. Information   on where to find official "best-track" files from the various warning   centers will be passed along from time to time.      The track files are not being sent via e-mail.  They can be retrieved   from the archive sites listed below.  (Note: I do have a limited e-mail   distribution list for the track files.    If anyone wishes to receive   these via e-mail, please send me a message.)      Both the summaries and the track files are standard text files   created in DOS editor.  Download to disk and use a viewer such as   Notepad or DOS editor to view the files.       The first summary in this series covered the month of October,   1997.

Another website where much information about tropical cyclones may   be found is the website for the UK Meteorological Office.  Their site   contains a lot of statistical information about tropical cyclones   globally on a monthly basis.  The URL is:
TROPICAL CYCLONE REPORTS AVAILABLE       JTWC now has available on its website the Annual Tropical Cyclone   Report (ATCR) for 2005 (2004-2005 season for the Southern Hemisphere).   ATCRs for earlier years are available also.       The URL is:
Also, TPC/NHC has available on its webpage nice "technicolor"   tracking charts for the 2006 Atlantic and Eastern North Pacific   tropical cyclones; also, storm reports for all the 2006 Atlantic   and Eastern North Pacific cyclones are now available, as well as   track charts and reports on storms from earlier years.

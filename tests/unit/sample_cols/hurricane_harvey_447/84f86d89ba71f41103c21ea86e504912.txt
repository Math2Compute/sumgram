State Farm Insurance Agent Bob Bonar welcomed a steady stream of customers affected by Hurricane Harvey Wednesday afternoon.
Using a generator to power lights and a hotspot for Internet, Bonar and his employees had already started the claims process for many of his customers. Many had to start the claims process in person as phone lines in the City of Port Lavaca remained down Wednesday.
“It’s been non-stop,” Bonar said. “As long as the generator holds up and as long as we can find a hotspot to get Internet service, then we’re OK,” Bonar said.
Bonar said his office is taking customers 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
“But we take it one day at a time,” he said.
Bonar said people should file claims with their insurance provider.Numerous resources are also available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency and access to help and information from a disaster is available at www.disasterassistance.gov .
According to the website, $37,171,994.71 in federal dollars were approved to provide assistance for the counties affected by Harvey.
A few days into the Harvey aftermath, rumors began to swirl about how insurance assistance could be affected by recent state legislation.
State Sen. Lois Kolkhorst assured Texas residents that House Bill 1774 would not affect the insurance claims process.
“Unfortunately, misinformation is being spread during this catastrophe while we are fervently working to rescue and provide relief to Texans,” Kolkhorst said.
“Instead, it affects only the lawsuits that sometimes follow the claims process,” Kolkhorst added. “Furthermore, this legislation supported by the vast majority of coastal lawmakers does not create a new deadline for action by policyholders. Texans will continue to have some of the strongest consumer protections in the nation.”

Hurricane Harvey Aftermath
Monday, August 28, 2017 6:31 pm
The reason we are not sharing pictures far off main roads is because they are not cleared enough to ensure not getting flat tires. If you get a flat and can't repair it, or your spare is flat, you could be stuck. There's no place to fix a flat. Make sure you have some type of Fix a Flat if you come. If you do come to town plan on coming in and being gone by 7 pm. There are NO utilities. Electricity will not be restored for a minimum of two weeks, PROBABLY longer. The same goes for water. The reason for this is electricity and water must first be restored "up the line" before it gets to Aransas County.

ZCZC MIATCDAT5 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM TROPICAL DEPRESSION TEN SPECIAL DISCUSSION NUMBER   1 NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL 6 AM EDT SUN SEP 19 1999   SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES INCREASED CONVECTION NEAR AND EAST OF THE CENTER OF THE BROAD LOW PRESSURE AREA IN THE CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. OBSERVATIONS FROM BUOYS 42001 AND 42003 SUGGEST A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE AROUND 1005 MB...WITH 42003 REPORTING 30 KT WINDS AT 0900Z. THUS...ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION TEN.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS 345/04. A STRONG DEEP LAYER TROUGH IS FORECAST TO AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS. THIS...IN THEORY...SHOULD TURN THE CYCLONE NORTHEAST OR EVEN EAST-NORTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. OR FLORIDA. HOWEVER...MODEL GUIDANCE HAS A GREAT VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS. THE UKMET TAKES THE CYCLONE ON THE TRACK SUGGESTED BY THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN. ON THE OTHER HAND...THE AVN LETS THE DEPRESSION LINGER IN THE GULF UNTIL THE ONCOMING COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH CATCHES IT. THE AVN ALSO DEVELOPS A SECONDARY LOW OFF THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES WITH THE SYNOPTICALLY SUGGESTED TRACK AND IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN A NORTHERLY UKMET AND A SOUTHERLY LBAR AND NHC98E.   DEEP CONVECTION IS STILL POORLY ORGANIZED...WITH SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF ONLY 25 KT. THE LARGE SCALE MODELS DEVELOP AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE EASTERN GULF. HOWEVER...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUGGESTS A WEAK TROUGH OR SHEAR AXIS IS EMBEDDED IN THE ANTICYCLONE JUST WEST OF THE DEPRESSION...WHICH RESTRICTS OUTFLOW TO THE WEST. THESE POINTS SUGGEST INTENSIFICATION SHOULD BE SLOW. LATER INTENSIFICATION WILL DEPEND ON HOW THE DEPRESSION INTERACTS WITH THE DEVELOPING TROUGH. BY 72 HOURS THE CYCLONE COULD SHEAR OFF...START BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL...OR EVOLVE INTO A HYBRID OR SUBTROPICAL CYCLONE. THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL BRING THE SYSTEM TO 50 KT IN 48 HOURS AND KEEP THAT INTENSITY AT 72 HOURS. THIS IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN POSSIBLE WEAKENING DUE TO SHEAR AND POSSIBLE DEEPENING DUE TO BAROCLINIC INTERACTION.  WHILE NO WATCHES OR WARNINGS WILL BE ISSUED WITH THIS PACKAGE...THEY MAY BE REQUIRED LATER TODAY. RESIDENTS OF THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN GULF COAST SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

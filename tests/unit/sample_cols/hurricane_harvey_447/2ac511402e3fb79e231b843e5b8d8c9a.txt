Aransas County RV Park destroyed by Hurricane Harvey
Posted:
Paradise Lagoon
ROCKPORT -
There are many memories of Hurricane Harvey at this Aransas County RV Park.  More than half of the RV's here are flipped on their sides.  Many other RV parks in the area look just like Paradise Lagoon.
For some folks, RV parks are a weekend getaway.  Vacation getaway.  For others, this is home.  But now, that's changed, at least for the foreseeable future
Kevin and Bridgett Faglie just drove in from La Vernia to salvage what they could in Harvey's aftermath.  Friends had sent them pictures of what to expect when they finally saw their RV.
"And when you saw the pictures, you said...remember, this is a family show.  Seeing the camper like this, it brings back all the memories that we had here, but that's not going to end just because of this," they said. 
Chris and Courtney Smith told us a FEMA rep visited them this morning and told them to anticipate further contact within 7-10 days.
"Our insurance, we talked to them yesterday, and they gave us the ok to come down and salvage some personal items," said Jimmy Harlos, a retired San Antonio fire fighter while standing on top his flipped RV.  It was a weekend getaway for him and his wife.
They feel fortunate they're alive and still have a place to call home.  They can always get another RV.  Some of their friends here at the RV park are not as fortunate.

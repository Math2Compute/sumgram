Corpus Christi — This is an update as of 4:45 p.m. Monday, August 28. Nueces Electric Cooperative is down to its last 34 members who are without electric service.
NEC crews began restoration efforts immediately following the storm’s passing with damage assessments being made Saturday morning and restoration work beginning around 1 p.m. Saturday afternoon. In the first 24 hours, NEC restored nearly 6,000 members without power after the extensive damage Hurricane Harvey caused to parts of NEC’s service area.
Crews will continue working until all services have been restored. If you are returning home from evacuation and find your power is out, please call our outage number at 1-800-632-9288.
“Our crews have continued to work around the clock for the past three days in order to get our members’ power restored as soon as possible,” Avan Irani, NEC Assistant General Manager said. “We are so grateful for the outpouring of support from our members during this difficult time. Since there is still some damage in our service area, please remember that if you see any downed power lines, please contact the cooperative as soon as possible and stay at least fifteen feet away from them. Any information on fallen trees, broken poles and damaged lines is greatly appreciated.”
Please remember that if you have electric appliances or equipment that have been exposed to water, never assume they are safe to use after they have dried. Before you try to use any electrical appliance that has been exposed to water, take it to a qualified service technician. The item may be fine, it may need reconditioning, or it might require replacement.

BROWNSVILLE – On Sunday, Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Brownsville) released the following information for constituents in need of disaster assistance due to Hurricane Harvey:
“Yesterday, several of my colleagues in the Texas delegation, Gov. Abbott and I sent letters to President Trump requesting he declare a major disaster for the State of Texas as a result of Hurricane Harvey. Last night, President Trump issued a State of Disaster Declaration for the state of Texas, triggering the release of federal funds to help victims recover from Hurricane Harvey in the following counties: Bee, Goliad, Kleberg, Nueces, Refugio and San Patricio.
“Today (Monday), I was briefed by FEMA Administrator Brock Long, National Weather Service Deputy Regional Director Mike Coyne, Texas Department of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd, U.S. Coast Guard Atlantic Area Vice Admiral Karl Schultz, and American Red Cross Executive Director of Recovery Operations Harvey Johnson on an update on Hurricane Harvey’s impact thus far, as well as its potential impact throughout Texas and Louisiana.
“If you are a resident of Bee, Goliad, Kleberg, Nueces, Refugio or San Patricio County and your home has sustained damage from Hurricane Harvey, I urge you to seek a safe shelter first, and then apply for assistance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Download the FEMA mobile app to set up alerts for the latest weather updates, shelter information, disaster resources, preparedness information and safety tips, in English and in Spanish. The app provides a customizable checklist of emergency supplies, maps of open shelters and recovery centers, disaster survival tips, and weather alerts from the National Weather Service. The app also enables users to receive push notifications reminding them to take important steps to prepare their homes and families for disasters.
“Those who would like to assist victims of Hurricane Harvey may do so by donating or volunteering with the American Red Cross, or other organizations assisting with the situation. To donate or volunteer through the American Red Cross, visit redcross.org or call 1-800-RED CROSS or text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation.
“My office continues to work with federal, state, and local officials to provide resources for those in need. For more information, please contact my office at hurricaneassistance@mail.house.gov .”

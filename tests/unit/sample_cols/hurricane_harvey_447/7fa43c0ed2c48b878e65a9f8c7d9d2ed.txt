As of Tuesday afternoon, the remnants of Tropical Storm Harvey are producing heavy showers over Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Popular resort areas such as Cancun and Cozumel are currently being affected by the tropical moisture. The remnants of Harvey are expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico by Wednesday. In the Gulf,conditions will be favorable for re-development. The National Hurricane Center says there's a high chance that Harvey will re-develop into a tropical storm by Wednesday. Harvey is then expected to further strengthen before moving towards, ifÂ  not making landfall somewhere from northeast Mexico to the Texas Gulf Coast around Friday.
If Harvey strengthens into a hurricane before making landfall, this will bring the threat of storm surge, strong winds, and even flooding. If Harvey encounters light winds and stalls after making landfall, major flash flooding may become a concern.
For now, areas along the Texas Gulf Coast are currently under the biggest threat, this could include Corpus Christi. We will continue to monitor the tropics and keep you up to date on Action 10 News and at KZTV10.com.

Giant beehive found in walls of Houston home following Hurricane Harvey
1 / 82
Back to Gallery
A Houston woman found some noisy visitors in her flood-damaged home last week during rebuilding efforts.
A massive beehive was discovered in Karen Knight's bathroom Wednesday after contractors ripped down some sheetrock following Hurricane Harvey. Knight's home flooded through the roof, leaving six inches of water in her house on Beechnut Street.
Knight inherited the home from her aunt in the summer of 2014. Her aunt had told her about bees living in the walls of the home but they couldn't be found.

Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma took a major toll on the U.S. and U.S. territories in ways that still seem unimaginable. Many areas will never be the same. Thousands were left homeless – men, women, children, and animals, sometimes the forgotten

"The bees are not aggressive," Knight told Chron.com Tuesday morning. "We would see the occasional bee in the house."
Knight has been under a financial strain since her daughter was involved in a car accident this summer that left her paralyzed. While Knight waits for FEMA to help repair the damage caused by Harvey, GOTCHA Pest Control has come to her aid.
The company, who Knight contacted, is charging her $100 to remove the bees; a job this size normally runs $1,200-$1,500, said GOTCHA operations manager Kristy Fleener. The decision to help Knight was made by GOTCHA owner Claude Griffin after hearing her story.
This is the first bee-related call GOTCHA has received since Harvey.
"Rodents have been a big nuisance since Harvey," Fleener said. "Large cockroaches are also coming up from the sewers."

000 AXNT20 KNHC 111154 TWDAT   TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL   805 AM EDT THU AUG 11 2011  TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION FOR NORTH AMERICA...CENTRAL  AMERICA...GULF OF MEXICO...CARIBBEAN SEA...NORTHERN SECTIONS OF  SOUTH AMERICA...AND ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE AFRICAN COAST FROM THE  EQUATOR TO 32N. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS BASED ON SATELLITE  IMAGERY...WEATHER OBSERVATIONS...RADAR...AND METEOROLOGICAL  ANALYSIS.  BASED ON 0600 UTC SURFACE ANALYSIS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY THROUGH  1015 UTC.  ...SPECIAL FEATURES...  A 1010 MB LOW CENTERED NEAR 13N33W IS WELL EMBEDDED WITHIN THE  MONSOON TROUGH ACROSS THE TROPICAL ATLC MOVING W AT 10 KT.  ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOW-LEVEL CYCLONIC MONSOON GYRE  CONTINUES TO CONSOLIDATE AND COVERS A SMALL AREA FROM 08N-18N  BETWEEN 28W-41W...OF WHICH ENCOMPASSES A TROPICAL WAVE ANALYZED  ALONG 12N36W TO 22N39W AND IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE WESTWARD OVER  THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS. THE LOW CONTINUES TO POSITION ITSELF ON  THE SOUTHWESTERN PERIPHERY OF AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE  CENTERED NEAR 20N31W. LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE ALONG WITH A  FAVORABLE MIDDLE TO UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENT ENVIRONMENT IS  SUSTAINING SCATTERED MODERATE CONVECTION S OF THE LOW CENTERED  FROM 07N-14N BETWEEN 30W-37W. NO SIGNIFICANT DEEP CONVECTION IS  NORTH OF THE LOW CENTER OR ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROPICAL WAVE.  ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR SOME SLOW  DEVELOPMENT INTO A TROPICAL CYCLONE DURING THE NEXT 48 HOURS AS IT MOVES WESTWARD 10 TO 15 MPH.  ...TROPICAL WAVES...  TROPICAL WAVE IS ANALYZED FROM 10N20W TO 17N20W MOVING W AT  10-15 KT. A 1010 MB LOW IS CENTERED NEAR THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF THE WAVE AXIS NEAR 10N20W. EXAMINING UPPER AIR TIME-SECTION  ANALYSES FROM DAKAR SENEGAL SHOWS THIS WAVE PASSED AFTER 11/0000 UTC. FURTHERMORE...GLOBAL MODEL ANALYSIS AND FORECAST  STREAMLINES AT 850 MB AND 700 MB INDICATE THE WAVE IS LARGELY  LOCATED ALOFT AND THAT IT IS ANTICIPATED TO CONTINUE PROPAGATING  WESTWARD OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. SCATTERED MODERATE AND ISOLATED  STRONG CONVECTION IS FROM 09N-14N BETWEEN 19W-25W. SLOW  DEVELOPMENT INTO A TROPICAL CYCLONE IS POSSIBLE DURING THE NEXT 48 HOURS.  TROPICAL WAVE IS ANALYZED FROM 12N71W TO 20N66W MOVING W AT 15  KT. THE WAVE REMAINS WITHIN AN AREA OF HIGHER TOTAL PRECIPITABLE  WATER VALUES ADVECTING ACROSS THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN SEA FROM  14N-21N BETWEEN 62W-70W. WHILE AN UNFAVORABLE UPPER LEVEL  ENVIRONMENT IS IN THE VICINITY OF THE WAVE...THUS INHIBITING ANY  SIGNIFICANT DEEP CONVECTION...LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE CONVERGENCE IS  GENERATING A FEW LOW-TOPPED ISOLATED SHOWERS FROM 15N-19N  BETWEEN 66W-71W.  ...ITCZ/MONSOON TROUGH...  THE MONSOON TROUGH EXTENDS FROM THE AFRICAN COAST NEAR 19N16W  ALONG 12N17W TO 10N19W TO 14N28W TO 05N45W. THE INTERTROPICAL  CONVERGENCE ZONE AXIS EXTENDS FROM 05N45W TO 03N51W. ASIDE FROM  CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWO TROPICAL WAVES NOTED  ABOVE...NO SIGNIFICANT DEEP CONVECTION IS NOTED ON SATELLITE  IMAGERY.  ...DISCUSSION...  GULF OF MEXICO... AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE IS CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL GULF  NEAR 26N91W AND CONTINUES TO SUPPORT A SURFACE RIDGE AXIS  EXTENDING FROM THE SW NORTH ATLC THROUGH THE FLORIDA STRAITS TO  A 1014 MB HIGH CENTERED NEAR 25N83W THEN NW OF THE TEXAS COAST  NEAR 30N94W. SHORTWAVE INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES MUCH  OF THE GULF IS UNDER CLEAR SKIES AND FAIR CONDITIONS THIS  MORNING...AS MUCH OF THE CONVECTION INITIATED LAST  AFTERNOON/EVENING HAS DISSIPATED OVER THE EASTERN GULF WATERS  AND THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. A SURFACE TROUGH REMAINS ANALYZED  OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA FROM DAYTONA BEACH TO THE TAMPA BAY REGION  WITH ONLY A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS NOTED ON MOSAIC DOPPLER RADAR  IMAGERY OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS SOUTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS. THE  SURFACE RIDGE IS FORECAST TO REMAIN ACROSS THE GULF ALONG 24N  THROUGH FRIDAY AND GRADUALLY SHIFT NORTHWARD TO 26N/27N BY  SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY.  CARIBBEAN SEA... WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS  EXTENDING FROM THE SW NORTH ATLC ACROSS EASTERN CUBA NEAR 21N77W  TO THE YUCATAN PENINSULA NEAR 19N89W. AT THE SURFACE...MOSTLY  FRESH TO MODERATE EASTERLY TRADES CONTINUE WITH ONLY A FEW  ISOLATED SHOWERS DUE TO LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE CONVERGENCE OCCURRING  OVER WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CARIBBEAN FROM 13N-17N BETWEEN  73W-85W. THE MONSOON TROUGH EXTENDS NORTH OF PANAMA ALONG 10N  WITH ISOLATED SHOWERS AND TSTMS OCCURRING S OF 12N. FARTHER  EAST...A TROPICAL WAVE CONTINUES TO MOVE WESTWARD INTO THE  CENTRAL CARIBBEAN WITH ISOLATED SHOWERS OCCURRING FROM 15N-19N  BETWEEN 66W-71W. THE EASTERLY TRADES ACROSS CENTRAL PORTIONS OF  THE CARIBBEAN ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN STRONG THROUGH FRIDAY DUE  TO A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE ALONG 24N IN THE W ATLC.  ATLANTIC OCEAN... MIDDLE TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING IS NOTED ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY  ACROSS THE SE CONUS THAT EXTENDS EASTWARD INTO ATLC OFFSHORE  ZONES N OF 30N W OF 70W. WHILE A COLD FRONT IS SUPPORTED BY THIS  UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING NORTH OF THE DISCUSSION AREA...A PAIR OF  SURFACE TROUGHS ARE OVER THE W ATLC WATERS AND FLORIDA PENINSULA  THIS MORNING. ONE SURFACE TROUGH IS ANALYZED FROM 29N78W TO  24N79W AND THE OTHER IS ANALYZED FROM 31N81W ACROSS THE NORTHERN  FLORIDA PENINSULA TO THE TAMPA BAY REGION. LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE  CONVERGENCE IS GENERATING ISOLATED SHOWERS AND TSTMS OVER THE W  ATLC WATERS W OF A LINE FROM 32N70W TO 22N78W. FARTHER EAST...AN  UPPER LEVEL LOW IS CENTERED NEAR 38N46W WITH THE ASSOCIATED  UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS EXTENDING SOUTHWARD TO 29N51W. THIS  UPPER LEVEL FEATURE SUPPORTS A SURFACE TROUGH ANALYZED FROM  32N47W TO 24N56W. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND TSTMS COVER THE AREA FROM  21N-28N BETWEEN 45W-56W. THE REMAINDER OF THE EASTERN ATLC IS  UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A SURFACE RIDGE ANCHORED BY A 1028 MB  HIGH CENTERED OVER THE AZORES NEAR 38N26W. THE RIDGE AXIS  EXTENDS FROM THE HIGH ALONG 32N33W TO 20N50W.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PLEASE VISIT HTTP://WWW.HURRICANES.GOV/MARINE  $$ HUFFMAN

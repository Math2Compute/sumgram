Royal Dutch Shell said Sunday the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey is causing the shutdown of its massive refining and petrochemical complex in Deer Park.
Shell is closing one of Texas' largest refineries, which can refine more than 315,000 barrels of crude oil a day into gasoline and other petroleum products.Â 
"The top priority of Shell Deer Park is to operate in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Due to continued inclement weather conditions from Hurricane Harvey, Shell Deer Park is conducting a controlled/planned shut down of the refinery and chemical plant," Shell said in an email response.
The Texas Gulf Coast produces more than 25 percent of the nation's gasoline and these shutdowns are expected to lead to fuel price spikes and potential shortages.

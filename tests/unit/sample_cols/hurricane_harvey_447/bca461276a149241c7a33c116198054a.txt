Families who lost everything in the Rockport area and other surrounding counties tried to get a sense of normalcy by enrolling their children into Gregory-Portland I.S.D.
Parents formed a line down the hallway at the G-P I.S.D Administration building bright and early this morning. These parents are from the five school districts that have been closed indefinitely.
As they filled out registration paperwork, the children saw familiar faces of their classmates who were also displaced because of Hurricane Harvey. Parents said although their kids are ready for school they're still a little nervous.
Dr. Paul Clore, Superintendent of G-P I.S.D asks parents to be patient while they get all the children enrolled.Â 
There's also a school supply donation drive to help Hurricane Harvey students that have been displaced. For more information on that donation, go to: https://www.gofundme.com/gpisd-school-supply-drive

AUSTIN, Texas – At the direction of Gov. Greg Abbott more than 2,000 members of the Texas Military Department’s Army National Guard, Air National Guard and Texas State Guard are assisting in recovery efforts following landfall of Hurricane Harvey.
Soldiers and Airmen are currently providing support to flooding regions of Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast. Partnering with local first responders Guardsmen are assisting in search and rescue operations, swift water rescues and evacuations of flooding areas.
Members of the Texas State Guard are mobilized to provide local shelter operations and provide a tracking system that helps evacuees locate loved ones checking into shelters
Additional Guardsmen are on standby and will join operations as requested by the Texas Department of Emergency Management.
“We are here to help our communities,” said Brig. Gen. Patrick M. Hamilton, Commander of Domestic Operations Task Force. “working alongside our partner agencies, and local first responders, we are focused on deploying Guardsmen and resources where they are needed to save lives.”
Hurricane Harvey is the first hurricane to make a direct landfall on the Texas coast since 2008.
“Nothing is more important to our Guardsmen that the chance to serve their local community.” Hamilton said. “Helping our neighbors when they need us most is the heart of The Guard, and why we choose to become Citizen Soldiers and Airmen.

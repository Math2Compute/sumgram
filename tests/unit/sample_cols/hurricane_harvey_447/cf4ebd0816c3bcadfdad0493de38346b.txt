CORPUS CHRISTI, TEXAS — The current path of Tropical Depression Harvey shows potential impact in Nueces Electric Cooperative's service territory. On Monday, Alert Level One of NEC’s Emergency Response Plan was activated, however given the progression of the storm, NEC has now moved to Alert Level Two as of this morning. TD Harvey is to be expected to make landfall within the next 72 hours and NEC’s service area is in the projected path.
Ahead of the storm, NEC has made the decision to close our Ricardo Service Center located at 123 CR 1026 in Ricardo, Texas on Friday, August 25. All other offices will remain open to assist members during normal business hours.
As always, the impacts of the storm can be unpredictable, but NEC is prepared with our emergency response plan to ensure that we can safely and efficiently maintain and restore power to all of our members.
“Our employees will be working hard throughout the storm to make sure that we are bringing our members the best service possible,” Avan Irani, NEC Assistant General Manager said. “Our mission is to continually improve our members’ quality of life by providing reliable and cost effective electric service, so our number one priority it to keep the lights on for all of our members in the safest and most efficient way possible.”

Hurricane Harvey dumped inches of rain on Victoria County, but the National Weather Service hasn’t been able to figure out exactly how much.
Hurricane Harvey damaged a National Weather Service station at the Victoria Regional Airport, which means officials weren’t able to track exactly how much it rained on Sunday, according to weather officials.
“We lost the station completely,” Alina Nieves, who works for the National Weather Service in Corpus Christi, said Tuesday. “We had no data coming in.”
Weather experts tried to use data from other areas, but it wasn’t enough to count the exact rainfall totals on Sunday, she said. Because of Hurricane Harvey’s dangerous aftermath, crews weren’t able to fix the station until Monday, she said.
“The conditions were just not good for us,” she said.
However, weather officials do have some estimates from radar, which show it rained between 10 to 12 inches in the past week, Nieves said.
Additionally, weather experts have exact rainfall totals in Victoria for Friday, Saturday and Monday -- 4.33, 1.16 and 0.57 inches, respectively, according to weather data.
In the Crossroads area, weather data show it rained up to 15 inches in parts of Refugio County, while more western counties received up to 3 inches of rain during the 24-hour period when Hurricane Harvey made landfall, according to estimates.
During a 24-hour period ending early Sunday, counties received anywhere from 0.75 to nearly 4 inches rain. On Monday and Tuesday, Crossroads-area counties received anywhere from 0.25 to 0.75 inches of rain, according to estimates.

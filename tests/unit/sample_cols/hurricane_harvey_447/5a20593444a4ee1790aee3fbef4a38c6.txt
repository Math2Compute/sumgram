The City of Corpus Christi continues 24/7 emergency operations with full Emergency Operations Center activation (readiness level 1) on Saturday. Police, Fire and City employees have worked around-the-clock to prepare for the storm, ride-out and begin recovery. The City of Corpus Christi has also been engaged in providing early assistance to our neighboring communities experiencing devastation from Hurricane Harvey.
The following work continues in order to bring the City back to pre-storm status: 
Securing alternative power sources for a variety of operations. This includes additional generator supplies for the O.N. Stevens Water Treatment Plant and various wastewater operations. The boil water notice and recommended reduction of wastewater are still in place due to Hurricane Harvey.
Disaster Assessment Team assessments including an initial “windshield” driving assessment followed by a more detailed analysis have been conducted since dawn this morning. These include five person teams from Fire, Police, Code Enforcement, Development Services and Risk Management.
Utilities has been at work repairing signs, traffic lights, water main breaks and debris management. The goal is to clear main roads and then focus on neighborhood debris. Due to the high winds, many trees were blown over with many in the streets. Removing debris is critical in order that AEP can mobilize crews to repair damaged infrastructure.
Additional work is going-on throughout the City in every department. The goal is to recover from Hurricane Harvey and ensure the safety of the public, first responders and city employees.

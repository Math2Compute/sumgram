DALLAS, TX  — In response to the hurricane warning issued for Hurricane Harvey, Dallas-based PlainsCapital Bank has taken steps to safeguard its employees and customers.  Beginning Friday, Aug. 25, 2017, PlainsCapital Bank branches in Corpus Christi, Alice, and Victoria will be closed until further notice.  Additionally, the PlainsCapital Bank Port Isabel branch will close at noon on Friday, Aug. 25, 2017, until further notice. 
Starting Friday, PlainsCapital Bank branches will post signage announcing the weather-related closings.  Information about the closings has also been communicated to the public via the Bank’s website and social media channels, which will serve to provide the most updated information. 
“Our senior management and emergency preparedness teams have been monitoring this situation closely,” said PlainsCapital Bank President and CEO Jerry Schaffner.  “We made the decision to close our Gulf Coast area branches once the hurricane warning was issued to allow time for our employees to join their families and complete their preparations.”
Schaffner added that while the Bank secures its properties, PlainsCapital will continue to monitor the storm’s progress.
PlainsCapital Bank customers can always access their accounts through the online banking feature available on the PlainsCapital Bank website and through mobile banking which is available on iPhone and Android mobile devices with the PlainsCapital Bank app. The online and mobile banking services enable customers to conduct their banking transactions—deposits, transfers, bill pay, etc.—at any time no matter the weather.  For online banking and mobile banking support or to speak with a PlainsCapital Bank service representative, customers are encouraged to call 866-762-8392.
Due to the closings, special deadlines for money wires and other services may be set, so PlainsCapital encourages customers to contact their respective Gulf Coast area branch if they have questions.  All ATMs will remain operational as long as there is power. 
“We want to communicate to our customers that during this time their account information is safe and accessible to them through a number of channels,” said Schaffner.  “We also want to reassure them that we are here to assist with any needs they may have during this time.  Safety and security is the priority now.  Banking should not be something about which our customers need to be worrying.”

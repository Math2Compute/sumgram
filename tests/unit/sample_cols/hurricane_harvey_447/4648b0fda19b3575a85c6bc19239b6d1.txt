After struggling with unseasonably dry conditions all summer, Thanksgiving Monday brought record-setting rainfall amounts across Nova Scotia.
The intense trough of low pressure — the remnants of Hurricane Matthew meeting up with a system off the coast of the Carolinas — hit some parts of the province harder than others.
Sydney has been hit hardest so far, with 225 millimetres as of Tuesday at 3 a.m. AT. According to Environment Canada records for October between 1981 and 2010, Sydney usually receives an average of 142.2 millimetres of rain during the whole month.
Monday's rainfall blew Sydney's previous record for extreme daily rainfall out of the water when 128.8 millimetres fell on Aug. 17, 1981.
The unofficial rainfall numbers from Environment Canada, in millimetres, as of 3 a.m. AT on Tuesday:
Baccaro Point: 72.9

000 AXNT20 KNHC 182358 TWDAT   TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL   805 PM EDT THU AUG 18 2011  TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION FOR NORTH AMERICA...CENTRAL  AMERICA...GULF OF MEXICO...CARIBBEAN SEA...NORTHERN SECTIONS OF  SOUTH AMERICA...AND ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE AFRICAN COAST FROM THE  EQUATOR TO 32N. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS BASED ON SATELLITE  IMAGERY...WEATHER OBSERVATIONS...RADAR...AND METEOROLOGICAL  ANALYSIS.  BASED ON 1800 UTC SURFACE ANALYSIS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY THROUGH  2315 UTC.  ...SPECIAL FEATURE... THE TROPICAL WAVE IN THE W CARIBBEAN EXTENDS FROM 18N81W TO  12N80W. A WELL DEFINED MID LEVEL CYCLONIC CIRCULATION IS ALONG  THE WAVE AXIS NEAR 16N. SCATTERED MODERATE/ISOLATED STRONG  CONVECTION IS FROM 14N-17N BETWEEN 78W-82W. A LOW LEVEL  CIRCULATION IS BECOMING BETTER DEFINED AND A SURFACE LOW COULD  BE FORMING ABOUT 90 NM ENE OF CAPE GRACIAS A DIOS NICARAGUA.  ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS REMAIN CONDUCIVE FOR A TROPICAL  DEPRESSION TO FORM AS LONG AS THE DISTURBANCE REMAINS OFFSHORE.  THIS SYSTEM HAS A HIGH CHANCE OF BECOMING A TROPICAL CYCLONE  BEFORE IT MOVES INLAND OVER CENTRAL AMERICA. TROPICAL STORM  CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE ALONG THE COASTS OF HONDURAS...THE BAY  ISLANDS...GUATEMALA AND BELIZE DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO AS THE  SYSTEM MOVES GENERALLY WESTWARD AT 9-13 KT.   A TROPICAL WAVE WAS INTRODUCED ON THE 18/1800 UTC MAP ALONG THE  COAST OF W AFRICA NEAR 16W FROM 13N-21N. A BROAD MID LEVEL  CYCLONIC CIRCULATION COVERS THE AREA FROM 8N-16N E OF 22W TO  INLAND OVER W AFRICA. THIS WAVE IS ALREADY SHOWING SIGNS OF  ORGANIZATION WITH A STRONG SURFACE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION  DEVELOPING ON THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF THIS TROPICAL WAVE.  SCATTERED/NUMEROUS STRONG CONVECTION IS WITHIN 75 NM ALONG A  LINE FROM 12N19W 14N19W TO INLAND OVER SENEGAL NEAR DAKAR.  CLUSTERS OF SCATTERED MODERATE/ISOLATED STRONG CONVECTION COVER  THE AREA FROM 8N-13N BETWEEN 17W-25W. UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE  FORECAST TO BE CONDUCIVE FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT DURING THE NEXT  COUPLE OF DAYS. THIS SYSTEM HAS A MEDIUM CHANCE OF BECOMING A  TROPICAL CYCLONE DURING THE NEXT 48 HOURS AS IT MOVES  WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AT 10 TO 15 MPH.  REGARDLESS OF  DEVELOPMENT...LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN AND STRONG GUSTY WINDS ARE  POSSIBLE IN THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY.     ...TROPICAL WAVES...  TROPICAL WAVE IN THE CENTRAL TROPICAL ATLC EXTEND FROM 19N43W  ALONG 15N43W TO JUST N OF THE MONSOON TROUGH NEAR 13N41W MOVING  W 15-20 KT. THIS WAVE IS WELL DEFINED IN THE LOWER LEVELS  COVERING A BROAD AREA AND BECOMING TILTED NW/SE. WAVE REMAINS  EMBEDDED WITHIN A SURGE OF DEEP LAYER MOISTURE. SCATTERED  SHOWERS ARE FROM 13N-17N BETWEEN 40W-46W.   ...THE ITCZ/THE MONSOON TROUGH...  THE DEPICTION ON THE SURFACE ANALYSIS HAS A SPLIT MONSOON TROUGH  ALONG 16W AS A RESULT OF A VERY ACTIVE TROPICAL WAVE MOVING OFF  THE COAST OF AFRICA...SEE SPECIAL FEATURES ABOVE. ONE PORTION OF  THE MONSOON TROUGH EXTENDS ACROSS AFRICA. THE OTHER PORTION OF  THE MONSOON TROUGH EXTENDS FROM A DEVELOPING CIRCULATION  ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TROPICAL WAVE INTO THE TROPICAL ATLC NEAR  13N17W ALONG 15N31W RUNNING JUST S OF THE TROPICAL WAVE NEAR  12N41W TO 9N48W. THE ITCZ AXIS CONTINUES FROM 9N48W ALONG 10N55W  TO SOUTH AMERICA NEAR 10N62W. SCATTERED MODERATE/ISOLATED STRONG  CONVECTION IS WITHIN 150 NM S OF THE MONSOON TROUGH BETWEEN  43W-48W. SMALL CLUSTERS OF SCATTERED MODERATE CONVECTION DOT THE  AREA FROM 5N-10N BETWEEN 25W-37W.   ...DISCUSSION...  GULF OF MEXICO... BROAD UPPER RIDGE DOMINATES THE GULF N OF 24N ANCHORED OVER  CENTRAL TEXAS. AN INVERTED UPPER TROUGH IS OVER THE BAY OF  CAMPECHE EXTENDING FROM THE ISTHMUS OF TEHUANTEPEC TO THE N  COAST OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA NEAR MERIDA GENERATING SCATTERED  SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS INLAND ALONG THE  COAST OF MEXICO. UPPER LEVEL CONVERGENCE IS GENERATING SCATTERED  SHOWERS/ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE W GULF FROM 24N-26N  BETWEEN 92W-96W. A SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS FROM S GEORGIA THEN  INTO THE GULF NEAR TALLAHASSEE ALONG 27N85W 24N88W TO 24N92W.  AFTERNOON SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED INLAND OVER THE  FLORIDA PENINSULA AND SE LOUISIANA WITH SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS  MOVING TO ALONG THE IMMEDIATE COASTLINES AND OVER THE FLORIDA  KEYS. THIS SURFACE TROUGH EFFECTIVELY SPLITS THE SURFACE RIDGE  FROM THE W ATLC WITH A 1016 MB HIGH OVER THE W GULF NEAR 27N95W.  WEAK SURFACE RIDGE WILL PREVAIL OVER THE N GULF THROUGH MON. A  TROPICAL WAVE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE ACROSS THE BAY OF CAMPECHE SUN  AND MON.  CARIBBEAN SEA... THE PRIMARY CONCERN THIS EVENING IS THE POTENTIAL FOR TROPICAL  FORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROPICAL WAVE IN THE W  CARIBBEAN...SEE SPECIAL FEATURES ABOVE. THIS FEATURE IS  DOMINATING THE CARIBBEAN AND IS GENERATING ADDITIONAL SCATTERED  SHOWERS/ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS COVERING THE AREA BETWEEN  75W-86W. AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE COVERS THE CARIBBEAN W OF 73W  ANCHORED NEAR THE CAYMAN ISLANDS. A LARGE UPPER TROUGH IN THE  CENTRAL ATLC EXTENDS S OVER THE NE CARIBBEAN GENERATING  SCATTERED SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS FROM N OF  15N BETWEEN 70W-75W LEAVING THE REMAINDER OF THE CARIBBEAN UNDER  MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES THIS EVENING. A SURFACE LOW IS EXPECTED TO  DEVELOP ALONG THE CARIBBEAN TROPICAL WAVE WITH THE POSSIBILITY  OF TROPICAL CYCLONE FORMATION...SEE SPECIAL FEATURES ABOVE. THE  LOW WILL THEN MOVE W THROUGH THE GULF OF HONDURAS FRI AFTERNOON  TO INLAND OVER BELIZE SAT NIGHT. A TROPICAL WAVE IN THE CENTRAL  ATLC WILL ENTER THE NE CARIBBEAN SUN TO THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN ON  TUE.  ATLANTIC OCEAN... A SHORTWAVE UPPER TROUGH EXTENDS ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST INTO  THE W ATLC THEN THROUGH 32N78W TO NEAR GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND  GENERATING SCATTERED SHOWERS/ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WITHIN 120  NM OF LINE FROM OVER W CUBA NEAR SANTA CLARA ACROSS THE BAHAMAS  TO NEAR 32N74W. A LARGE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH COVERS THE REMAINDER  OF THE W ATLC AND INTO THE CENTRAL ATLC EXTENDING FROM BEYOND  32N55W THEN THROUGH AN UPPER LOW NEAR 26N57W ACROSS HISPANIOLA/  PUERTO RICO INTO THE NE CARIBBEAN. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND  POSSIBLE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE WITHIN 120 NM OF LINE FROM  27N60W TO 32N55W. LOW LEVEL SPEED CONVERGENCE AND AN ABUNDANCE  OF DEEP LAYER MOISTURE IS GENERATING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND  POSSIBLE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS E OF THE LESSER ANTILLES FROM  11N-15N BETWEEN 57W AND THE LESSER ANTILLES. THE REMAINDER OF  THE ATLC BASIN IS DOMINATED BY A SURFACE RIDGE THAT EXTENDS FROM  A 1025 MB HIGH OVER THE AZORES THROUGH A 1022 MB HIGH NEAR  33N59W TO THE FLORIDA COAST NEAR DAYTONA BEACH LEAVING THE  REMAINDER OF THE ATLC UNDER FAIR CONDITIONS THIS EVENING. TWO  AREAS OF SAHARAN DRY AIR ARE ACROSS THE ATLC BASIN. THE LARGEST  S ACROSS THE TROPICAL ATLC FROM 15N-30N E OF 57W. THE SECOND IS  SMALLER N OF THE E CARIBBEAN FROM 20N-28N BETWEEN 63W-70W. THE W  ATLC SURFACE RIDGE WILL GRADUALLY WEAKEN SAT THROUGH MON.   FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PLEASE VISIT HTTP://WWW.HURRICANES.GOV/MARINE  $$ PAW

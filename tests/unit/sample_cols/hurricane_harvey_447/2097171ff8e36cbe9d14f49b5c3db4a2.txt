CORPUS CHRISTI - Gov. Greg Abbott visited the Coastal Bend region where he received a briefing and gave an update on Hurricane Harvey. The Governor then toured the region speaking with Texans impacted by the storm and surveying the extensive damage in the areas affected by Harvey. During his visit, the Governor was inspired by the resilience and bravery of the communities in that region, and he reaffirmed Texas' commitment to doing everything possible to help people rebuild and recover. 
"A Texas-sized storm requires a Texas-sized response, and that is exactly what the state will provide," said Governor Abbott. "While we have suffered a great deal, the resiliency and bravery of Texan's spirits is something that can never be broken. As communities are coming together in the aftermath of this storm, I will do everything in my power to make sure they have what they need to rebuild." 
FEMA Administrator agreed.
"While this is still a dangerous situation with a long response effort ahead, the state and people of Texas are resilient," said FEMA Administrator Brock Long. "FEMA was here before the storm hit, and we will be here as long as needed, actively coordinating the full resources of the federal government, to support Governor Abbott and the state."
Senator John Cornyn also joined the Governor on the ground Monday to survey the region and help facilitate coordination of the federal, state, and local response to the recovery effort in Texas.

REFUGIO —Refugio County is beginning to transition into the recovery phase. Local, State, and Federal resources continue working together to address needs of public safety, shelter and food. The concerted effort on restoration of public utilities and infrastructure are top priority.
Pods are being set up to distribute food, water, and ice in each community. The locations of these pods are located at the bottom of this page.  
There are still road closures due to down power transmission and distribution lines making travel very hazardous.
A 10 p.m. curfew is in effect until further notice.

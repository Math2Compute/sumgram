Areas affected
Part of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season
Hurricane Harvey was the costliest tropical cyclone on record, inflicting nearly $200 billion in damage, primarily from widespread flooding in the Houston metropolitan area , breaking the previous record set by Hurricane Katrina . It was the first major hurricane [nb 1] to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 , ending a record 12-year span in which no hurricanes made landfall at such an intensity in the country. In a four-day period, many areas received more than 40 inches (100 cm) of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters, causing catastrophic flooding. With peak accumulations of 64.58 in (164.0 cm), Harvey was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States . The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes, displaced more than 30,000 people, and prompted more than 17,000 rescues.
The eighth named storm , third hurricane , and the first major hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles , reaching tropical storm status on August 17. The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day, passing just south of Barbados and later near Saint Vincent . Upon entering the Caribbean Sea , Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia early on August 20. The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucatán Peninsula , before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August 23. Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August 24, regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day. While the storm moved generally northwest, Harvey's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August 24–25; however, Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category 4 intensity later that day. Hours later, Harvey made landfall near Rockport, Texas , at peak intensity. Afterwards, rapid weakening ensued, and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state, dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the Lone Star state. On August 28, it emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in Louisiana on August 29. As Harvey drifted inland, it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September 1, before dissipating two days later.
Harvey caused at least 91 confirmed deaths: 1 in Guyana , [1] and 90 in the United States. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Total damage from the hurricane is estimated at $198.63 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster ever in the United States. [8]

Formation and initial degeneration (Caribbean)[ edit ]
Early on August 13, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave on the western coast of Africa. Amid favorable environmental conditions, the wave was expected to merge with a broad area of low pressure to its west, southwest of Cape Verde and gradually organize thereafter. [9] Instead, the two disturbances remained separate, with the broad trough continuing westward and the tropical wave moving farther north, eventually becoming Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten . [10] On August 17, shower and thunderstorm activity in association with the trough began to show signs of organization, [11] while high-resolution satellite showed an increasingly defined low-level circulation. [12] As such, the NHC initiated advisories on a potential tropical cyclone, allowing tropical storm watches and warnings to be hoisted for portions of the Lesser Antilles . [13] An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft deployed to the disturbance later that afternoon found a well-defined center and tropical storm-force winds, prompting the NHC to upgrade it to Tropical Storm Harvey at 21:00 UTC. [14]
Following its designation, the tropical storm moved swiftly westward into the Caribbean Sea under the influence of an expansive ridge of high pressure to its north. An environment of moderate wind shear complicated the weather of the storm's intensity, with global forecast models suggesting dissipation in the central Caribbean, whereas statistical and hurricane models suggested the potential for Harvey to be near hurricane strength in later days. [14] Over the next day, the storm changed little in structure, remaining poorly organized with its low-level center on the eastern edge of associated deep convection . [15] Harvey's presentation began to deteriorate early on August 19; its convective pattern became elongated while the circulation became less defined. In fact, a reconnaissance aircraft was unable to find a loosely-closed circulation at 850 mb (4,781 ft), though it did locate one at lower levels. [16] Harvey was downgraded to a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC on August 19; [17] six hours later, based on continued data from a reconnaissance aircraft , it was declared an open tropical wave . [18]

Early on August 20, the NHC began monitoring the remnants of Harvey for redevelopment. Although the effects of strong upper-level winds and dry air were expected to limit development in the near-term, conditions were expected to become more conducive to tropical storm and hurricane conditions when the disturbance entered the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and especially in the Bay of Campeche . [19] Despite an increase in convective organization, the disturbance still lacked a well-defined center as it approached the Yucatán Peninsula . [20] While traversing inland, satellite images and surface observations indicated that the circulation became better defined. [21]
Regeneration, peak intensity, and stalling (Gulf of Mexico)[ edit ]
A reconnaissance aircraft investigating the remnants of Harvey around 15:00 UTC on August 23 indicated that it once again acquired a well-defined center, and the NHC upgraded it to a tropical depression accordingly. [22] The system began to slowly consolidate amid an increasingly favorable environment, [23] attaining tropical storm intensity by 06:00 UTC on August 24. [24] Later that morning, Harvey began to undergo rapid intensification as an eye developed and its central pressure quickly fell. [25] By 17:00 UTC, the storm was upgraded to the third hurricane of the season. [26] Slight entrainment of dry air slowed the intensification process, however, by the next day, Harvey was able to quickly strengthen into a Category 3 major hurricane by 19:00 UTC. [27] Further deepening occurred as the storm approached the coast of Texas, with Harvey becoming a Category 4 hurricane at 23:00 UTC, based on reconnaissance aircraft data. [28] Around 03:00 UTC on August 26, the hurricane made landfall at peak intensity at Rockport with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and an atmospheric pressure of 938  mbar (27.7  inHg ). [29] Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 and the strongest in terms of wind speed to hit the country since Charley in 2004 . It was the first hurricane to strike Texas since Hurricane Ike in 2008 , [30] the first major hurricane in the state since Bret in 1999 , and the strongest in Texas since Carla in 1961 . [31]
Harvey as a hurricane on August 24
After striking land, the storm moved over the Copano Bay and made a second landfall in Texas just north of Holiday Beach at 06:00 UTC on August 26 as a Category 3 hurricane. [32] Afterwards, rapid weakening ensued as its speed slowed dramatically to a crawl, and Harvey weakened to a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC on August 26. [33] For about two days the storm stalled just inland, dropping very heavy rainfall and causing widespread flash flooding. Harvey's center drifted back towards the southeast, positioning itself near or just off the Texas coast at Matagorda by 15:00 UTC on August 28. [34] Once offshore, convection blossomed and allowed the once-exposed low-level circulation to become obscured. An Air Force reconnaissance plane investigating the system during the afternoon of August 29 found that maximum winds had increased to 50 mph (85 km/h). [35] Around 09:00 UTC the next morning, Harvey made its third and final landfall just west of Cameron, Louisiana , with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). [36]
Final landfall and dissipation (Eastern United States)[ edit ]
The system continued north and then north-northeast, weakening to a tropical depression over central Louisiana around 00:00 UTC on August 30. [37] Associated convection with Harvey became focused north of the center and along a warm front on September 1, indicating that the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 15:00 UTC that day. [38] However, Harvey's remnants continued moving northeastward, while slowly weakening. Late on September 2, the WPC issued its final advisory on Harvey's remnant low, while it was located over Ohio . [39] Harvey's remnants continued to drift northward, before being absorbed by another low pressure system north of Lake Erie , late on September 3. [40]
Caribbean and Latin America[ edit ]
Tropical Storm Harvey in the Eastern Caribbean on August 18
Tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the Windward Islands were issued starting at 15:00 UTC on August 17, about six hours before Harvey developed. At that time, a tropical storm watch was posted for Dominica , while a tropical storm warning became in effect in Barbados , Martinique , Saint Lucia , and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines . [13] All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on August 18, as the storm continued westward into the Caribbean. [41]
In Honduras, a green alert was issued for the Atlántida , Islas de la Bahía , Colón , Cortés , Gracias a Dios , Olancho , and Yoro departments . About 8 inches (20 cm) of precipitation was expected along the coast, while inland areas were forecast to receive 2.76 to 3.15 in (7.0 to 8.0 cm) of rain. [42] As the remnants of Harvey approached Mexico, the Civil Protection Secretary of the state of Campeche issued a blue alert, indicting minimal danger. [43] When Harvey redeveloped at 15:00 UTC on August 23, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch in Tamaulipas from Boca De Catan to the mouth of the Rio Grande . [44] The watch remained in effect until 21:00 UTC on August 25, after it became evident that the storm no longer posed a significant threat to that area. [45]
FEMA worked with the Coast Guard , Customs and Border Protection , and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prepare for the storm and its aftermath. The agency placed disaster response teams on standby at emergency posts in Austin, Texas , and Baton Rouge, Louisiana . [46]

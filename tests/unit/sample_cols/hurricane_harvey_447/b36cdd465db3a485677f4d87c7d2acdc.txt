NEW HARVEY STATS:Â  Thousands of Texans still displaced across the nation
"We remain committed to serving this community and are in active negotiations for another site," spokeswoman Cyndy Garza-Roberts said in a statement.
Two other H-E-B locations flooded severely during the storm. The company on Friday reopened a Joe V's Smart Shop near Timberwood that took on several feet of water, and it's still assessing damage at a relatively new store in Kingwood that likely won't open until the beginning of next year.
Harvey forced several other grocers to close stores for extensive repairs.
Fiesta Mart on Tuesday reopened its location on Mesa and Tidwell, but two of its stores remained closed. It location on Clay Road near the Addicks Reservoir took on as much as 10 feet of water during the storm, and its location on Interstate 10 near Northwood is still under renovation.
Kroger, which lost two stores in the Champions Forest area, expects to open both by the end of the year.

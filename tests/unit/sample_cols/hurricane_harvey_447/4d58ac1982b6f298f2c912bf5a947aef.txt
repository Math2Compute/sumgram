000 AXNT20 KNHC 172347 TWDAT   TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL   805 PM EDT WED AUG 17 2011  TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION FOR NORTH AMERICA...CENTRAL  AMERICA...GULF OF MEXICO...CARIBBEAN SEA...NORTHERN SECTIONS OF  SOUTH AMERICA...AND ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE AFRICAN COAST FROM THE  EQUATOR TO 32N. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS BASED ON SATELLITE  IMAGERY...WEATHER OBSERVATIONS...RADAR...AND METEOROLOGICAL  ANALYSIS.  BASED ON 1800 UTC SURFACE ANALYSIS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY THROUGH 2330 UTC.  ...SPECIAL FEATURE... AN ACTIVE TROPICAL WAVE IS MOVING THROUGH THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN  EXTENDING S OF JAMAICA WITH AXIS FROM 18N77W TO 12N78W MOVING W  15-20 KT. SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES A CLEAR MID-LEVEL  CIRCULATION AROUND THE AXIS...BUT A WELL-DEFINED SURFACE  CIRCULATION HAS NOT FORMED AT THIS TIME. ENHANCED DEEP LAYER  MOISTURE ACCOMPANIES THIS WAVE...ALONG WITH SCATTERED HEAVY  SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM 13N-19N BETWEEN 74W-80W. THE  SYSTEM CONTINUES TO SHOW SIGNS OF ORGANIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL  CONDITIONS APPEAR CONDUCIVE FOR A TROPICAL DEPRESSION TO FORM  DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO. INTERESTS ALONG THE COAST OF THE  WESTERN CARIBBEAN SEA SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS  DISTURBANCE. THIS SYSTEM HAS A HIGH CHANCE OF BECOMING A  TROPICAL CYCLONE DURING THE NEXT 48 HOURS AS IT MOVES GENERALLY  WESTWARD.  ...TROPICAL WAVES...  WELL DEFINED TROPICAL WAVE IS ACROSS THE CENTRAL TROPICAL ATLC  ALONG 19N33W TO THE MONSOON TROUGH NEAR 13N34W MOVING W 15-20  KT. SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS LOW-LEVEL CYCLONIC FLOW AROUND THE  WAVE AXIS CONCENTRATED AT THE INTERSECTION WITH THE MONSOON  TROUGH. THIS CYCLONIC FLOW WAS ALSO EVIDENT IN EARLIER ASCAT  DATA. THE WAVE IS EMBEDDED WITHIN A SURGE OF DEEP LAYER MOISTURE  ON TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER IMAGERY. ISOLATED MODERATE TO STRONG  CONVECTION IS W OF THE WAVE AXIS FROM 12N-15N BETWEEN 36W-39W.  ...THE ITCZ/THE MONSOON TROUGH...  THE MONSOON TROUGH EXTENDS FROM THE AFRICAN COAST NEAR 20N16W SW  ACROSS THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ALONG 16N24W TO S OF A TROPICAL  WAVE NEAR 13N34W TO 8N45W. THE EXTENSION OF THE MONSOON TROUGH  HAS DISRUPTED THE CONFLUENCE ALONG THE ITCZ AND THEREFORE WAS  NOT ANALYZED ON THE 1800 UTC SURFACE ANALYSIS. HOWEVER...AN AREA  OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IS FROM 6N-15N BETWEEN  47W-57W ASSOCIATED WITH AN AREA OF ENHANCED MOISTURE EVIDENT IN  TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER IMAGERY.  ...DISCUSSION...  THE GULF OF MEXICO... THE LONGWAVE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS NOW OVER THE WEST ATLC. IN  ITS WAVE...UPPER LEVEL NE FLOW COVERS THE DISCUSSION AREA THIS  EVENING...PROVIDING DRY AIR ALOFT AND SUPPRESSING DEEP  CONVECTION ACROSS THE AREA. HOWEVER...AT SURFACE...A WEAK  STATIONARY FRONT LINGERS OVER THE NE GULF...ANALYZED FROM 28N83W  TO 27N86W TO 29N90W. NO CONVECTION IS IN THE VICINITY OF THE  FRONT AS THE IT CONTINUES TO WEAKEN IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. THE  REMAINDER OF THE BASIN IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A WEAK SURFACE  RIDGE AROUND A 1017 MB HIGH IN THE NW GULF NEAR 27N94W. THIS  FEATURE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN OVER THE WRN HALF OF THE BASIN  DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  THE CARIBBEAN SEA... AN UPPER LEVEL INVERTED TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE FAR NW CARIBBEAN  GENERATING WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS N OF 18N W OF 82W. AN ACTIVE  TROPICAL WAVE IS S OF JAMAICA SUPPORTING SCATTERED HEAVY SHOWERS  AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM 13N-19N BETWEEN 74W-80W. SEE SPECIAL  FEATURES SECTION ABOVE FOR MORE DETAILS. SCATTER SHOWERS ARE OFF  THE IMMEDIATE COAST OF PANAMA AND COSTA RICA ASSOCIATED WITH THE  MONSOON TROUGH EXTENDING ACROSS THESE TWO COUNTRIES. MOSTLY FAIR  WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE OBSERVED ELSEWHERE WITH A FEW ISOLATED  SHOWERS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE TRADE WIND FLOW. EXPECT THE TROPICAL  WAVE TO MOVE WWD INTO THE WEST CARIBBEAN BRINGING SIGNIFICANT  CONVECTION TO CENTRAL AMERICA THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  THE ATLANTIC OCEAN... A LONGWAVE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE WEST ATLC  GENERATING A LARGE AREA OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED  THUNDERSTORMS N OF 27N BETWEEN 65W-75W. THE UPPER TROUGH ALSO  SUPPORTS A FRONTAL BOUNDARY ALONG 32N75W TO THE COAST OF FLORIDA  NEAR 29N81W. AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IS CENTERED NEAR 23N57W WITHOUT  ANY CONVECTION. THE REMAINDER OF THE BASIN IS DOMINATED BY  SURFACE RIDGING AROUND A 1025 MB HIGH NEAR 32N58W AND A 1024 MB  HIGH NEAR 33N34W PROVIDING MOSTLY FAIR WEATHER ELSEWHERE ACROSS  THE DISCUSSION AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW TWO  AREAS OF AFRICAN DUST. THE FIRST IS E OF 45W WITH CLEARING  AROUND THE TROPICAL WAVE ALONG 34W. THE SECOND AREA IS N OF THE  CARIBBEAN BETWEEN 60W-74W.

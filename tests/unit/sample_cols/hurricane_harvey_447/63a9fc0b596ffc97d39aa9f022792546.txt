Woman trapped in home: 911 told us not to call 01:28
Among those stranded by the storm is Ify Echetebu, 30, who spoke to CNN from her aunt's house in Dickinson, not far from Galveston Bay. Along with her fiancé, grandparents, a friend and several teenagers, Echetebu is trapped on the second floor of the house as floodwaters creep up the staircase. She can see the rooftops of submerged cars in driveways, she said.
On the first floor, the water is up to her waist, she said. Emergency services know she and 10 others are holed up in the home, she said, but because emergencies take priority, she doesn't expect to be rescued until tomorrow, Echetebu said.

"We're nervous to stay here, but we are sleeping in shifts," she said. "Now we're having to deal with sewage in the water, river water, bayou water, water moccasins, snakes, gators."
Not far away, a rescue operation saved 20 to 25 residents of La Vita Bella assisted-living facility in Dickinson.
"They were up to their waist," Galveston County Commissioner Ken Clark said. "If they were in a wheelchair, they could have been up to their neck."
Residents of a nursing home in Dickinson, Texas, were rescued Sunday.
After a record 22 inches fell on the county in one day, rescuers set out before dawn Sunday to save those who braved the storm. Officials quickly realized they did not have enough boats for the rescue operations and asked private boat owners to help, said County Judge Mark Henry, responsible for disaster response in the county.
As of Sunday evening, between 800 and 1,200 people had been rescued from their homes in Galveston County, Henry said.
As authorities warned people not to take shelter in attics, unless they have axes handy to break through their roofs, several residents provided CNN with their accounts of riding out the storm.
"We are still stranded in our home with little kids and the water keeps rising," Houston resident Janet Castillo said Sunday morning. "We have (tried calling several numbers), but their lines are all busy or they don't answer."
We are going on fumes & our hearts ache for community we serve, but we will not stop! We are leveraging more assets with every passing hour.

Jake Lewis of New Braunfels, Texas, said he woke up to ankle-deep water in the Houston hotel where he is staying.

"We have nowhere to go," he said. "I have a 2016 Chevy Silverado and the water is up to the door panels. The water keeps rising."
One of two confirmed fatalities happened in Houston when a woman drove her vehicle into high water and couldn't make it across, city police said. She got out of her vehicle, was overtaken by floodwaters and drowned.

Downtown Houston is reflected in the flooded Buffalo Bayou on Wednesday, August 30, five days after Hurricane Harvey  made landfall in Texas. The Category 4 storm came ashore late Friday, August 25, just north of Port Aransas, and has caused historic flooding. Correction: Previous versions of this gallery incorrectly reported that Hurricane Harvey is the strongest storm to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005. Harvey is actually the strongest storm to make landfall in the United States since Charley in 2004.

In a Sunday news conference, Abbott said, "We want to stress when there is heavy rainfall and flooding, the importance of staying off the road. If you drive into water, you're taking your life into your own hands."
Portions of major highways, including Interstates 10, 45 and 610, were submerged and unnavigable. Houston resident Dion Laurent said the White Oak Bayou flooded I-10 and I-45.

Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said he understands the compulsion to find safer ground, but urged people to think twice before venturing out into high water and to consider unforeseen dangers, such as manhole covers being lifted from their holes.
Lt. Craig Cummings of the Texas Department of Public Safety said attempts to drive to safety may be futile anyway, as it took him two and a half hours to drive 20 miles in Houston on Sunday.
"There's 60 barricaded locations as of midnight. Most thoroughfares are impassable. Several hundred structures are flooded, and we are expecting that number to rise," he said.
In Brazoria County, south of Houston, officials set up an evacuation route for all residents living west of State Highway 288 and south of State Highway 6, ordering them to "LEAVE NOW!" under a mandatory evacuation order. Those in need of shelter can take refuge in the Bell County Expo Center in Belton, officials said.
Houston knew it was at risk of flooding. Why didn't the city evacuate?
The 911 dispatchers in the nation's fourth-most populous city have received 2,000 requests for rescue, Mayor Turner said. Houston Fire Chief Samuel Peña said his department had responded to 2,500 calls and have about 1,000 more waiting to be serviced.
Gonzalez tweeted that many high-water rescues were performed overnight in Houston, some involving children or residents with medical issues, including one person suffering from cardiac arrest. Stranded residents were saved from vehicles on the highway. Airboats were employed in some instances, he said.

000 AXNT20 KNHC 170004 TWDAT   TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL   805 PM EDT TUE AUG 16 2011  TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION FOR NORTH AMERICA...CENTRAL  AMERICA...GULF OF MEXICO...CARIBBEAN SEA...NORTHERN SECTIONS OF  SOUTH AMERICA...AND ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE AFRICAN COAST FROM THE  EQUATOR TO 32N. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS BASED ON SATELLITE  IMAGERY...WEATHER OBSERVATIONS...RADAR...AND METEOROLOGICAL  ANALYSIS.  BASED ON 1800 UTC SURFACE ANALYSIS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY THROUGH 2345 UTC.  ...TROPICAL WAVES...  TROPICAL WAVE W OF CAPE VERDE ISLANDS IS FROM 18N27W TO 12N27W  CONTINUES MOVING WESTWARD AT APPROXIMATELY 15 KT. THE TOTAL  PRECIPITABLE WATER IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THIS WAVE CONTINUES  EMBEDDED WITHIN A HIGH MOISTURE REGION THAT EXTENDS FROM 12N-18N  BETWEEN 23W-31W...HOWEVER...NO SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION IS  ASSOCIATED TO IT.  TROPICAL WAVE IS MOVING W ACROSS THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN ALONG  18N66W TO 12N67W AT 20 KT. MID LEVEL CYCLONIC TURNING IS VERY  WELL OBSERVED ALONG THE WAVE AXIS. NUMEROUS MODERATE TO STRONG  CONVECTION IS FROM 15N-18N BETWEEN 66W-72W.  ...THE ITCZ/THE MONSOON TROUGH...  THE MONSOON TROUGH EXTENDS FROM THE W AFRICAN COAST NEAR 21N17W  AND THEN SW TO 11N30W 8N42W...THE ITCZ CONTINUES FROM THERE TO  THE COAST OF FRENCH GUIANA NEAR 5N52W. CLUSTERS OF MODERATE  CONVECTION ARE FROM 9N-12N BETWEEN 21W-25W. CLUSTERED MODERATE  TO STRONG CONVECTION IS FROM 7N-9N BETWEEN 29W-38W. ANOTHER  REGION OF MODERATE CONVECTION IS FROM 6N-11N BETWEEN 43W-49W.      ...DISCUSSION...  GULF OF MEXICO... A LONGWAVE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS MOVING EWD WITH AXIS NEAR 81W.  THIS IS SUPPORTING A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT THAT EXTENDS FROM  30N78W ENTERING THE FLORIDA E COAST NEAR 29N81W...IT MOVES FROM  THE W FLORIDA COAST NEAR 28N82W AND CONTINUES WESTWARD ENTERING  LOUISIANA COAST NEAR 29N90W. PRE-FRONTAL MODERATE TO ISOLATED  STRONG CONVECTION IS OCCURRING PARALLEL TO THE FRONT WITHIN 140  NM. THE REMAINDER OF THE BASIN IS UNDER WEAK SURFACE RIDGING  AROUND A 1015 MB HIGH IN THE NW GULF NEAR 28N93W. ALOFT...UPPER  LEVEL RIDGING COVERS THE WRN GULF AROUND AN UPPER LEVEL HIGH  CENTERED OVER SRN NEW MEXICO NEAR 32N106W. IN 24 HOURS THE HIGH  PRESSURE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY WHILE  THE FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE MOVING SLOWLY EASTWARD.  CARIBBEAN SEA... ISOLATED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS IN THE NW CARIBBEAN ARE   ASSOCIATED WITH A SURFACE TROUGH THAT IS CROSSING CENTRAL CUBA  AND PRODUCING HEAVY PRECIPITATION TO THE SE OF THE ISLAND.   THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN CARIBBEAN ARE IN A HIGH MOISTURE  ENVIRONMENT AS SHOWN BY THE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY...MOSTLY  ASSOCIATED TO A TROPICAL WAVE LOCATED ALONG 18N66W TO 12N67W.  NUMEROUS MODERATE STRONG CONVECTION ASSOCIATED TO THIS WAVE IS  FROM 15N-18N BETWEEN 66W-72W. ALOFT...WEAK UPPER RIDGING REMAINS  FROM CENTRAL TO WESTERN CARIBBEAN. IN 24 HOURS THE WAVE WILL  CONTINUE MOVING WESTWARD WITH THE TRADE WINDS BRINGING MORE  PRECIPITATION TO LA HISPANIOLA AND EASTERN CUBA.   ATLANTIC OCEAN... A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT IS IN THE W ATLANTIC EXTENDING FROM  30N78W AND ENTERING THE FLORIDA E COAST NEAR 29N81W. PRE-FRONTAL  SHOWERS ARE WITHIN 100 NM. SCATTERED SHOWERS ARE OVER THE  CENTRAL BAHAMAS ASSOCIATED TO THE SURFACE TROUGH MENTIONED IN THE  CARIBBEAN DISCUSSION. SURFACE RIDGING DOMINATES THE CENTRAL AND  EASTERN ATLANTIC N OF 20N...AT THE UPPER LEVEL WATER VAPOR  IMAGERY SHOWS MODERATE TO STRONG SUBSIDENCE SUPPORTING FAIR  WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR THIS REGION. THIS PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO  CONTINUE IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PLEASE VISIT HTTP://WWW.HURRICANES.GOV/MARINE  $$ RAMOS/GARCIA

BRIDGEWATER - It's getting crowded at the Somerset Regional Animal Shelter.
Eight dogs from Texas shelters that arrived by air at Morristown Airport on Tuesday night, are now at the shelter on Commons Way, getting used to their new surroundings after the 1,500-mile journey, getting checked out in preparation for being adopted.
"The dogs are doing well," said Brian Bradshaw, manager of the shelter.
The dogs are "very happy and playful," he said.

And though the dogs will add to the work at the animal shelter, Bradshaw said, the shelter is glad to do its part.
"We're Americans helping Americans," he said.
The 78 dogs that arrived in New Jersey on Tuesday were various breeds, sizes and ages and were already in Texas shelters before Hurricane Harvey dropped more than 50 inches of rain on the Lone Star State. The flight was part of the Sister Shelter WayStation program of St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center.

“In cases like this, moving pets who were already in the shelter system helps provide capacity for animals displaced by the storm and keeps them close to home,” said Heather Cammisa, president and CEO of St. Hubert’s, who founded the WayStation program.
Nora Parker, a goodwill ambassador for St. Hubert’s, said the dogs mainly slept during the flight that took most of the day. But the dogs woke up excited once they landed in Morristown at about 10 p.m. Tuesday. The flight from San Antonio included a stop in Tennessee to refuel.
"These dogs have had more excitement in the last four days than they've had in the rest of their lives," said Bradshaw.

In all, the shelter is hosting 30 dogs and 80 cats after a busy month of rescuing animals. In early August, the shelter rescued more than two dozen cats from a hoarding situation in Bridgewater. Last week, to relieve overcrowding at a shelter in Newark, Bradshaw brought dogs to the Bridgewater shelter.
More dogs from Texas are expected in the coming weeks and months as the floodwaters recede and more and more dogs, who have become separated from their owners, are found. That's why room has to be created at Texas shelters.
"This is going to be a long haul," Bradshaw said.
After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, the shelter took animals from Louisiana for months.

Rose Tropeano-Diglio, the shelter's assistant manager, emphasized that all of the dogs at the shelter are available for adoption and that any adoption, whether they're from Texas or New Jersey, will create more space for more dogs when they arrive.
Taking care of the extra dogs and cats at the shelter will mean extra expenses, including overtime costs and veterinary bills. The best way that residents can support the shelter, Bradshaw said, is through monetary donations that can be made through the shelter's website,  srasnj.org/donate/ .
Potential volunteers are requested to fill out an application at  srasnj.org/get-involved/ .

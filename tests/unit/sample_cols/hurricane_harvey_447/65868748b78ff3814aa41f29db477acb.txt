KARNES COUNTY — The slow-moving Hurricane Harvey finally made landfall at 10 p.m. on Friday night as a powerful category four storm near Rockport and after crossing Copano Bay, made another landfall on the northeast shore of Copano Bay just before 1 a.m.
The 1 a.m. advisory had the center of Harvey located at 28.2 north, 97.0 west with a maximum sustained wind speed of 125 miles per hour and a pressure of 942 mb, dropping it to a category three storm. Hurricane force winds extend out 40 miles from the center and tropical storm force winds could be felt 140 miles from the center.
The forward motion of Harvey had slowed to just six miles per hour and is expected to stall out, which could mean torrential rains for much of the area.
The following information also came out of the Friday morning emergency management meeting that took place at the Karnes County Sheriff’s Office:
Karnes County Emergency Management Coordinator Shelby Dupnik opened the 9 a.m. meeting and it was decided that the Incident Command Center would be located at the Karnes County Sheriff’s Office  training room. The EOC room number is 830-780-3931, ext. 122 and ext. 125.
Karnes County Sheriff Dwayne Villanueva and Chief Deputy Robert Ebrom were on hand to make reports and advised that all staff was active, working double shifts.
Tony Grose, the liaison for the San Antonio DPS office was also in attendance.
Sheriff Villanueva stressed for citizens to keep the phone lines open and to not inundate the 911 lines with unnecessary calls.
“For example, if the electricity is out, they know it already, so when hundreds of people call in it just jams the lines,” Villanueva said.”Also, any city or county officials can go to the command center if they want.”
It was also noted that sheltering for evacuees coming from out of town needed to keep going north to San Antonio, Austin or wherever. There are no shelters in Karnes County. The reception center for evacuees in San Antonio is located at 201 Gimbler, by the AT&T Center.
Other things noted during the meeting, were:
• DPS will be on call all the time. Five units now, but the state is already cutting into their resources to escort buses and other issues in other counties. They do have access to outside troops if needed.
• Kenedy and Karnes City police departments are on standby ready to help in any way.
• It’s a priority to keep the sewer plant up and running, but there’s a concern about people that live in the West Main area near the plant where it floods. It was decided that those residents should relocate.
• If anyone moves outside of the county to evacuate from Karnes County, the emergency management wants a list of people: to know their names, addresses and phone numbers.
• EMS directors said they’re not sure of all the details of the storm as it changes as it moves through. Wilson County will attend or assist Falls City if they are cut off from flooding. High wind concerns for emergency vehicles. Everyone needs to be fluid and flexible throughout the storm. Runge and Karnes City could be cut off from resources from flooding as well.
• The San Antonio River and Cibolo Creek are big concerns. Water task force, boats for evacuations in flooded areas will be considered.
• All city and county vehicles are topped off with gas and ready to roll.
• Kenedy is ready. If power goes out, the main intersection at Hwy. 181 and Hwy. 72 is on battery back up to keep that light working as long as possible. Will be manned for safety if needed. All other street lights at intersections do not have battery backup. The law is, when an intersection light is down, treat it as a four-way stop. That rule is everywhere. A dead intersection (power out) is automatically a four-way stop.
• Runge Mayor Homer Lott says he has a lot of residents on oxygen and that is a big concern. He is working with a durable medical company to ensure oxygen is available.
• Lavonne Murphy-Guzman, of Kenedy Health & Rehab, said they have a machine that refills small oxygen tanks if anyone needs to come by throughout the storm to refill oxygen tanks.
• The county fire departments said they’re ready and on standby as is the hospital. All staff are accessible with alerts if they need to bring in more staff.
• TxDOT will be working 12 hour shifts all weekend. They know their problem areas and will be canvassing the areas and ready to help out in all areas they can assist.
• Karnes Electric Coop – Inventory stocked up. They have state-wide resources. They had their own briefing this morning and ready to go. If a wire is down, always treat it as a live wire. This is a very bad situation and everyone needs to be cautious, especially first responders. They have a priority list and they know critical care facilities will be serviced first. Everyone needs to be patient throughout the storm.
• AEP – Everyone needs to realize that there will be high sustained winds for a long period of time, not just gusts but sustained. They have their critical facility list, as well. They will not be able to respond to every call constantly, so be patient and in due time everything will be repaired.
“Good communication is key. Stay calm. The dispatch department at the sheriff’s office is ready. The 911 call system is already set up to roll over to other counties when Karnes is inundated with too many calls. So when people call in, it could be answered by Wilson County, Atascosa County, Bandera County, etc. but those 911 calls will always be coordinated with our county for response,” Villanueva explained. “When you call the sheriff’s office main line, there is the automated answering que that is in place now. 830-780-3931 is the non-emergency number. Then press option 1 to speak to someone.”
“Resources will be stretched to the limit during the storm,” added Dupnik. “And as they say, turn around, don’t drown.”
• GEO – prisons – all okay.
• Nursing homes – all four in the county sheltering in place. All have generators, staff, medicines, supplies, food, etc.
“We should be okay unless there is damage to building then we would need help to evacuate residents and staff to somewhere in the county or out of the county. We would notify emergency management and sheriff if we needed help. Bus companies no longer sign contracts with nursing homes for evacuations because they cannot guarantee buses, but they are to be called if needed. Nursing homes might need school buses, vans, ambulances, personal vehicles, etc. to evacuate residents and staff,” Murphy-Guzman said. “Please do not forget the nursing homes if we are cut off from phones, power, sewage, etc. Please check on us if we are cut off from all communications.”
Dupnik also wanted to know the census of residents at all nursing homes in the county. They are as follows as of Aug. 25: Bluebonnet Nursing and Rehab, 54 residents; John Paul II Nursing Home, 45 with two residents in the hospital; Karnes City Health and Rehab, 35 residents; and Kenedy Health & Rehab, 51 residents.
•Karnes City ISD – Closed Friday – check back to see when school resumes.
•Kenedy ISD – Closed Friday and Monday – will see about Tuesday.
• Falls City ISD – Closed Friday – will make call about Monday later.
• Runge ISD – Closed Friday and Monday. Tuesday will be a teacher workday.
• All schools can become a shelter, but that would be coordinated through the command station by Dupnik and Villanueva.
• Red Cross will come in to help us if needed.
• Road and Bridge – Office ready. They have a lot of fuel for emergency management if needed. They are ready for barricades.
• Oil and Gas Industry – laying down drills and closing stations to skeleton crews. They have a lot of resources (man power, generators, vehicles) if emergency management needed to call on them. This is affecting industry, state and country since this storm is hitting us hard where the country relies on drilling oil/gas.
“It’s a good idea to take before and after pictures, especially for insurance purposes or FEMA,” noted Dupnik. “Document everything as we go through the storm.”
“Some facilities are using this as a ‘drill’ for their emergency preparedness. Good way to assess, reassess, and learn for future issues and storms. Businesses, homes, families, etc. should all debrief after storm to see where we can strengthen our emergency management procedures,” Dupnik explained. “Good time to prepare for the next storm after this one passes and everything goes back to normal. Assess strengths and weaknesses.”
It was also noted that Gillette could be cut off from flooding and they would get help from Nixon.
• San Antonio River Authority – monitoring river through signals set up along the river. They monitor the rising of the river, the cresting, and the descending.
• National Weather Service Website – go to river and streams tab. River bottoms – again can watch the rising, cresting, and descending of rivers, etc.
• Ag Extension Office – working with ranchers on protecting cattle and livestock. Coordinating with NOAA. Show barn could become a shelter for animals. Ag Extensions on standby. Could get assistance from other counties if needed, or vice versa.
• The food bank at the Methodist Church in Karnes City is a resource too.
• Churches in the community could become resources too, if push comes to shove. First Baptist Church Karnes City is not available or ready to help during this storm, but they were already in the process of working with Red Cross to assist them to prepare to be a place of refuge or evacuation shelter in the future. First Baptist Church Kenedy could become a shelter if emergency management needs them. They are on standby.
“Check on people, friends and neighbors that need to be moved or checked on during storm. Everyone helps everyone,” added Dupnik.
Facebook will be a good way to keep up with things as long as the power is still on and you have internet access. Everyone can join the following pages to know what is going on: Karnes County Sheriff’s Office and Karnes County Sheriff’s Office – Alerts.

Unnamed Tropical Storm - June 22-29, 1960
An area of thunderstorms formed in the southwest Gulf of Mexico on June 22nd.  The system slowly
developed as it moved north-northwest, and made landfall as a tropical storm.  Soon after moving
inland, the cyclone looped over South Texas, leading to heavy rains along the coastal plain near
Port Lavaca.  As it moved north-northeast, bursts of heavy rainfall were accompanied with the
system over Arkansas and Kentucky.  This system was originally designated as a tropical low,
but was reclassified a tropical storm after the fact, based on winds reported near its point of landfall.
The maximum seen in Kentucky not only represents their highest tropical cyclone-related rainfall
amount on record, but also their all-time 24 hour precipitation record (through 1998). The graphics
below use rainfall information from the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina.

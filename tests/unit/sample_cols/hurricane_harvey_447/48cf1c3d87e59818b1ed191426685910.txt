Thousands of people across social media came down on megachurch pastor Joel Osteen for not immediately opening the doors of Lakewood Church to be used as a shelter during Hurricane Harvey.
Osteen claimed the reason for not immediately opening the church was that it had also been flooded during the storms , but that didn't stop the flood of attacks from the internet.

Though Osteen had previously addressed comments , an interview with CBS  that aired the week of Oct. 22 show the pastor offering yet another response about his delayed reaction saying, "we've been here for 58 year taking care of the community, but social media can be powerful."
Now Playing:
"The church has always been open."
Media: Brandpoint
"The city set up a shelter about four miles from [Lakewood] that can house 10,000 people...they didn't need us as a shelter at that point," Osteen said . 
When asked if he'd do anything differently he responded with , "in hindsight yes, we're going to learn from it and move forward and do better next time."
The interview also highlighted Osteen's newest tour called "A Night of Hope," an "inspirational event" that will feature worship and an encouraging message from the pastor himself. 
Take a look through the gallery above to see some of the most iconic photos from Hurricane Harvey.

Tropical Storm Harvey - September 16-22, 1999
The tropical wave that spawned Harvey moved off the west coast of Africa on September 4th,
and tracked with little notice across the Atlantic and eastern Caribbean, as upper level winds
behind Hurricane Floyd did not allow the wave to develop.  The system got better organized
in the Western Caribbean on the 16th as upper level winds lightened, allowing a low pressure
area to form.  A tropical depression formed by the 19th in the southeast Gulf of Mexico,
strengthening into a tropical storm later that day.  A sharp turn to the left occurred as westerly
winds began to steer the system towards the Florida coast.  Harvey moved inland during the
afternoon of the 21st, and moved into the Atlantic by evening.  The storm accelerated towards
the northeast on the 22nd ahead of a deep upper level trough, and merged into a cold front
soon after.  Its track is below, courtesy of the National Hurricane Center.
On the graphic below is the storm total rainfall for Harvey.  Note the maximum in
southwest Florida, just to the left of where the center made landfall.  Rainfall into Georgia
and the Carolinas occurred along a coastal front which formed in response to Harvey's
circulation.  Data for this map was gathered from NCDC, and from the post storm report on
 the system by the National Hurricane Center.
Below is the calendar for Daily Precipitation Maps.  Note that the 24-hour periods end
at 12z that morning.

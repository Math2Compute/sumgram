DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK ------------------------------ At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 95.4 West.  Franklin is moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue for the next day or so.  On the forecast track, the center of Franklin is expected to cross the coast of the Mexican state of Veracruz later tonight or early Thursday.  An Air Force plane is approaching the hurricane and preliminary reports indicate that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is expected until the center crosses the coast.  Rapid weakening is expected after landfall in Mexico.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km).  The estimated minimum central pressure just reported by an Air Force plane was 983 mb (29.03 inches).   HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ---------------------- RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches are possible across the Mexican states of Tabasco, northern Veracruz, northern Puebla, Tlaxacala, Hidalgo, Queretar and eastern San Luis Potosi in eastern Mexico.  These rains will be capable of producing life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.  WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within the Hurricane Warning area tonight.  Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.  Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the Tropical Storm Warning area along the southern shore of the Bay of Campeche through tonight.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the Tropical Storm Warning area in eastern Mexico by this evening.  STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast near and to the north of where the center makes landfall in the Hurricane Warning area.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.   NEXT ADVISORY ------------- Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.  $$ Forecaster Avila  NNNN

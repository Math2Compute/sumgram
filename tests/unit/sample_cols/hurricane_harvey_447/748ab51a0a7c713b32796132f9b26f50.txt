What makes Houston a “uniquely American success story”?
What about its geography, industry, history and politics might also make it uniquely complicated to fix in the aftermath of Harvey?

The Times writes that Houston has “sprawled omnivorously, becoming the nation’s fourth-largest city and perhaps its purest model of untrammeled growth.” The article, “ A Storm Forces Houston, the Limitless City, to Consider Its Limits ,” continues:
Harvey has inundated a city perpetually looking to the future, a place built on boundless entrepreneurialism, the glories of air conditioning, a fierce aversion to regulation and a sense of limitless possibility.
The result has been a uniquely American success story, the capital of the world’s petroleum industry, and the place that sent a man to the moon, built the world’s biggest medical center and became a model of dizzying multiculturalism, with 145 languages spoken .
But Harvey’s staggering flooding is raising very un-Houstonian questions about whether there are, in fact, limits to the Houston model of perpetual growth, and whether humans can push nature only so far before nature pushes back with catastrophic force.
To add to that, it is in a region dotted with chemical factories, oil refineries, natural gas plants, and other potential sources of combustion and toxins. A series of small explosions shook a chemical plant northeast of Houston on Aug. 30 and more blasts were expected, after floodwaters shut down the cooling systems that kept the chemicals stable.
Meanwhile, runoff from the city’s sprawling petroleum and chemicals complex contains any number of hazardous compounds. Lead, arsenic and other toxic and carcinogenic elements may be leaching from some two dozen Superfund sites in the Houston area, reports The Times.
As reporting on this region continues over the days and weeks ahead, students might attempt to answer the two questions we pose at the top of this section about what makes this city both a unique success, and uniquely complicated to fix.

The Link Between “ Unnatural Rainfalls ” and Climate Change

Katrina wreaked devastation on New Orleans in 2005. Sandy pummeled the New York City region in 2012. Now Harvey.
And in the Op-Ed “ Harvey, the Storm That Humans Helped Cause ,” David Leonhardt writes:
Even before the devastation from Harvey, southeastern Texas was enduring a year unlike any before.
The daily surface temperature of the Gulf of Mexico last winter never dropped below 73 degrees. You can probably guess how many previous times that had happened: Zero.
This sort of heat has a specific effect on storms: Warmer weather causes heavier rainfall. Why? When the seas warm, more moisture evaporates into the air, and when the air warms — which has also been happening in Texas — it can carry more moisture.
The severity of Harvey, in other words, is almost certainly related to climate change.
Is our climate changing in detectable ways? What implications might these changes have on extreme weather? And how have these changes already affected millions of people around the world? Explore the evidence for climate change , including air temperature, ocean temperature, rainfall amounts and other indicators over the past century. What can you find out?
What can we do about these trends? Are there steps political leaders and city planners can take to mitigate the impact of these storms , here in the U.S. and around the world?

Education, Interrupted

When disaster strikes, normal life comes to a halt. What happens to students and teachers? Lisa Lyneé Daniels, a high school history teacher in Houston, writes :
I’m sitting in a bedroom in my friend’s house in southwest Houston, terrified for my city. The rain has poured down nonstop since Friday. I’m lucky to be safe and dry, but I worry for the thousands of others who are not as fortunate — particularly many of my students.
I teach United States history to 11th graders at a charter school, KIPP Houston High School, which has 945 students. Most of them live in areas that are prone to flooding, and the principal is hard at work getting donations for those in need .
One of my students was being evacuated when I called to check up on her. I can only imagine what she and other kids are going through right now.
More than 160 public school districts and 30 charter schools in Texas have been closed. School was supposed to start next Tuesday, but the storm has put that in question. “I don’t think we know for sure when everybody will be back,” a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency said on Aug. 29.

How should teachers, school and students deal with the immense challenge that Harvey has wrought? Already, over 160 school districts across Texas were closed. If you are among the affected, please tell us in a comment or via LNFeedback@nytimes.com how you are managing.
Update, Sept. 1: We have just heard from Leslie Jane Johnston, a teacher in Houston, via email. Here’s what she has to say:
I teach second grade at an inner city elementary school in Houston. My babies are only 7. Displaced students may be assigned to my school and thus my class. I may have more students than I have chairs. That is ok with me. I will find chairs, even if I have to bring some from my home or purchase. Providing stability for them is most important to me. The lesson I want to share with my little ones is to focus on the positive impacts (masses of people and organizations putting individual differences aside and helping each other) while respectfully acknowledging the negative impacts Harvey has caused.
Finally, if you are not in the Houston area, you might challenge your students to think about the issues a principal of an affected school might encounter. What would his or her priorities be? Why? Students might make a list of the things they would do or think about first if they were in charge of a school trying to weather the destruction.

Politics and Leadership

How should leaders respond to anticipated storms? They often get criticized afterward if the storm is weaker or stronger than anticipated. With Hurricane Harvey, leaders rose to the challenge in different ways.
Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, made a difficult call in the hours before the storm: He did not issue a mandatory evacuation order for Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city. Why is the decision to evacuate or not evacuate so difficult? What are the possible benefits and drawbacks? What lessons were learned from Houston’s mandatory evacuation before Hurricane Rita in September 2005? In retrospect, do you think the mayor made the right decision? Why or why not?
What about President Donald J. Trump? How have he and his administration responded to the storm? After all, the stakes could be high — few events test the effectiveness of an administration, or bear as many political risks, like a major natural disaster. Glenn Thrush writes in this White House Memo :
Hurricane Harvey was the rarest of disasters to strike during the Trump presidency — a maelstrom not of Mr. Trump’s making, and one that offers him an opportunity to recapture some of the unifying power of his office he has squandered in recent weeks.
So, what has the president done? On Aug. 29, President Trump visited Corpus Christi to survey some of the damage and demonstrate a commitment to the recovery effort in the state. He has also “toned down his presence on Twitter — mildly — relying more on the kind of official statements and news media availability used to by his predecessors.” But he also pardoned Joe Arpaio , the former Arizona sheriff who built a national reputation for harsh conditions in his county jail, and for cracking down against undocumented immigrants, just as Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas. What do you think of President Trump’s response to the crisis in Texas and Louisiana so far? What do you think he still needs to do?
And then there’s Congress. The Times reports :
The devastating storm will likely require a multibillion-dollar emergency relief measure that must somehow find its way through a Congress already contending with a potential government shutdown on Oct. 1, a must-pass measure to raise the government’s statutory borrowing limit and a months-overdue budget needed to secure a promised overhaul of the tax code.
The prospect of a disaster aid package is also reviving raw emotions from after Hurricane Sandy, when Northeastern Republicans found themselves pitted against conservative colleagues from other regions — including most of the Texas delegation — who objected to the roughly $50 billion relief package for the 2012 storm. With Texas still being pelted by rain, a few Republicans were already relitigating that bitter fight.
What words of advice do you have for members of Congress? And, what predictions can you make: Is a relief package likely to sail through, or do you think there will be significant roadblocks to passage?

Ask your students, Is the photo above real or fake? Would you retweet it? How would you decide?
During this storm, as during Hurricane Sandy, news and images have circulated quickly on social media, and, as The Times warns in “ A Shark in the Street, and Other Hurricane Harvey Misinformation You Shouldn’t Believe ,” some of it can lead people to online scams.

You might use this news as a case study in helping your students know how to determine the reliability of sources. Invite them to round up news and images from social media about Hurricane Harvey to bring in and analyze. (Our resources Fake News vs. Real News: Determining the Reliability of Sources and Evaluating Sources in a ‘Post-Truth’ World: Ideas for Teaching and Learning About Fake News can help.)
You might start by asking them:
•In a world where news can be reported by anyone with a cellphone, how do you decide what is true?
•What questions should you ask to find out?
•What personal rules might you develop to decide what news you post and when you post it?
•What harm might be done by not following those rules?

A large and complicated rescue operation is underway in Texas, and, so far, there’s no end in sight. But an outpouring of support helped save lives during the storm and in its aftermath.
As a class, view the videos in “ Moments of Hope and Inspiration Rise Above the Chaos of Harvey .” Ask students what stands out for them from the footage of people escaping fast rising floodwaters. Have students relay their own experiences with crisis situations, to focus on the help they received. Who came to their aid? What do they remember most?
Next, have students choose two of the following to read:

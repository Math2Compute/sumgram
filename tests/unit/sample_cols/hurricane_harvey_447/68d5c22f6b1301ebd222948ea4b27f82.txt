Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, confirmed that his department was aware of “at least two” two deaths from necrotizing fasciitis related to the hurricane.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, necrotizing fasciitis is a serious bacterial skin infection that spreads quickly, killing the body’s soft tissue. It can be deadly in a very short time, unless it is promptly diagnosed and treated with antibiotics and surgery.
The best way to prevent the infection is by cleaning and covering open wounds with dry bandages until they are healed.
Various types of bacteria can cause the infection, but public health experts consider Group A streptococcus to be the most common, with about 700 to 1,100 such cases occurring each year in the United States since 2010, the C.D.C. said.
Symptoms include warm skin with red or purplish areas of painful swelling after the injury, followed by fever, chills, fatigue and vomiting.

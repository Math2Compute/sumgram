Virus–host interactions
Abstract
Infections by the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses cause a rapidly fatal haemorrhagic                 fever in humans for which no approved antivirals are available 1 .                 Filovirus entry is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein (GP), which attaches                 viral particles to the cell surface, delivers them to endosomes and catalyses fusion                 between viral and endosomal membranes 2 . Additional host factors in                 the endosomal compartment are probably required for viral membrane fusion; however,                 despite considerable efforts, these critical host factors have defied molecular                     identification 3 , 4 , 5 . Here we describe a genome-wide haploid                 genetic screen in human cells to identify host factors required for Ebola virus                 entry. Our screen uncovered 67 mutations disrupting all six members of the homotypic                 fusion and vacuole protein-sorting (HOPS) multisubunit tethering complex, which is                 involved in the fusion of endosomes to lysosomes 6 , and 39 independent                 mutations that disrupt the endo/lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein                 Niemann–Pick C1 (NPC1) 7 . Cells defective for the HOPS                 complex or NPC1 function, including primary fibroblasts derived from human                 Niemann–Pick type C1 disease patients, are resistant to infection by Ebola                 virus and Marburg virus, but remain fully susceptible to a suite of unrelated                 viruses. We show that membrane fusion mediated by filovirus glycoproteins and viral                 escape from the vesicular compartment require the NPC1 protein, independent of its                 known function in cholesterol transport. Our findings uncover unique features of the                 entry pathway used by filoviruses and indicate potential antiviral strategies to                 combat these deadly agents.
Main
We have developed haploid genetic screens to gain insight into the biological processes             relevant to human disease 8 , 9 . Here we use this approach to explore the             filovirus entry pathway at an unprecedented level of detail. To interrogate millions of             gene disruption events for defects in Ebola virus entry, we used a replication-competent             vesicular stomatitis virus bearing the Ebola virus glycoprotein (rVSV-GP-EboV) 10 . Although this virus replicates in most cell lines, it inefficiently             killed near-haploid KBM7 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 1c ). In an             unsuccessful attempt to induce pluripotency in KBM7 cells by expression of OCT4 (also             called POU5F1), SOX2, MYC and KLF4 (ref. 11 ), we obtained             HAP1 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). HAP1 cells grew adherently and             no longer expressed haematopoietic markers ( Supplementary Fig. 1b ).             Most of these cells in early passage cultures were haploid for all chromosomes,             including chromosome 8 (which is diploid in KBM7 cells). Unlike KBM7 cells, HAP1 cells             were susceptible to rVSV-GP-EboV ( Supplementary Fig. 1c ), allowing             screens for filovirus host factors.
We used a retroviral gene-trap vector 9 to mutagenize early-passage HAP1             cells. To generate a control data set, we mapped ∼800,000 insertions using deep             sequencing ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Next, we selected             rVSV-GP-EboV-resistant cells, expanded them as a pool, and mapped insertion sites.             Enrichment for mutations in genes was calculated by comparing a gene’s             mutation frequency in resistant cells to that in the control data set ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). We identified a set of genes enriched for mutations in             the rVSV-GP-EboV-resistant cell population ( Fig. 1a , Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2 ). Nearly all of these candidate host factors are involved in the architecture and trafficking of             endo/lysosomal compartments. Our screen identified cathepsin B (CTSB), the only known             host factor for which deletion inhibits Ebola virus entry 5 . Further             inspection showed that mutations were highly enriched in genes encoding all six subunits             of the HOPS complex (VPS11, VPS16, VPS18, VPS33A, VPS39 and VPS41), for which we identified 67 independent mutations.             The HOPS complex mediates fusion of endosomes and lysosomes 6 and affects             endosome maturation 12 , 13 . The identification of all members of the HOPS             complex demonstrates high, and possibly saturating, coverage of our screen. We also             identified factors involved in the biogenesis of endosomes (PIKFYVE, FIG4) 14 , lysosomes (BLOC1S1, BLOC1S2) 15 , and in targeting of             luminal cargo to the endocytic pathway (GNPTAB) 16 . The strongest hit was             the Niemann–Pick disease locus NPC1, encoding an endo/lysosomal             cholesterol transporter 7 . NPC1 also affects endosome/lysosome fusion and                 fission 17 , calcium homeostasis 18 and HIV-1                 release 19 .

We subcloned the resistant cell population to obtain clones deficient for VPS11, VPS33A             and NPC1 ( Supplementary Fig. 4a , b and Fig.             1b ). These mutants displayed marked resistance to infection by rVSV-GP-EboV and             VSV pseudotyped with Ebola virus or Marburg virus GP ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 4c ). Cells lacking a functional HOPS complex             or NPC1 were nonetheless fully susceptible to infection by a large panel of other             enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, including VSV and recombinant VSV bearing different             viral glycoproteins ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig.                 5 ). The susceptibility of HAP1 clones to rVSV-GP-EboV infection was restored             by expression of the corresponding cDNAs ( Supplementary Fig.                 6a–c ).
Loss of NPC1 causes Niemann–Pick disease, a neurovisceral disorder             characterized by cholesterol and sphingolipid accumulation in lysosomes 7 .             We tested the susceptibility of patient primary fibroblasts to filovirus-GP-dependent             infection. NPC1-mutant cells were infected poorly or not at all by rVSV-GP-EboV             and VSV pseudotyped with filovirus GP proteins ( Fig. 2a, b ), and             infection was restored by expression of wild-type NPC1 ( Fig.             2c ).

Mutations in NPC2 cause identical clinical symptoms and phenocopy defects in lipid                 transport 20 . Surprisingly, NPC2-mutant fibroblasts derived             from different patients were susceptible to filovirus-GP-dependent infection ( Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 7 ), despite a             similar accumulation of cholesterol in NPC2- and NPC1-mutant cells ( Fig. 2a ). Moreover, cholesterol clearance from NPC1-null             cells by cultivation in lipoprotein-depleted growth medium did not confer susceptibility                 ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ). Therefore, resistance of NPC1-deficient             cells to rVSV-GP-EboV is not caused by defects in cholesterol transport per se.
Filoviruses display broad mammalian host and tissue tropism 21 , 22 . To             determine if NPC1 is generally required for filovirus-GP-mediated infection, we used Npc1-null Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Loss of NPC1 conferred complete             resistance to viral infection ( Supplementary Fig. 6d ) that was             reversed by expression of human NPC1 ( Supplementary Fig. 6e ). Certain small molecules such as U18666A (ref. 23 ) and the             antidepressant imipramine 24 cause a cellular phenotype similar to NPC1 deficiency possibly by targeting NPC1 (ref. 23 ). Prolonged U18666A treatment has been reported to modestly inhibit                 VSV 25 . However, we found that brief exposure of Vero cells and HAP1             cells to U18666A or imipramine potently inhibited viral infection mediated by Ebola             virus GP but not VSV or rabies virus G ( Fig. 2d and Supplementary Figs 9 and 10). Because U18666A inhibits rVSV-GP-EboV infection             only when added at early time points, it probably affects entry rather than replication                 ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Thus, NPC1 has a critical role in             infection mediated by filovirus glycoproteins that is conserved in mammals and probably             independent of NPC1’s role in cholesterol transport.
Filoviruses bind to one or more cell-surface molecules 2 , 26 , 27 and are             internalized by macropinocytosis 28 , 29 . In VPS33A- and NPC1-mutant cells, we observed no significant differences in binding or             internalization of Alexa-647-labelled rVSV-GP-EboV ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Figs 11 and 12a). Similar results were obtained by             flow cytometry using fluorescent Ebola-virus-like particles ( Supplementary                 Fig. 12b ). Moreover, bullet-shaped VSV particles were readily observed by             electron microscopy at the cell periphery and within plasma membrane invaginations             resembling nascent macropinosomes ( Fig. 3b ). Finally, VPS33A- and NPC1-null cells were fully susceptible to vaccinia virus             entry by macropinocytosis ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Thus, GP-mediated             entry is not inhibited at viral attachment or early internalization steps in NPC1- or             HOPS-defective cells, indicating a downstream defect.
Figure 3: Virus entry is arrested at a late step in cells deficient for the HOPS complex and NPC1.
a, Viral particles attach and internalize into HOPS- and NPC1-deficient cells. Indicated HAP1 clones were infected with Alexa-647-labelled rVSV-GP-EboV (blue) at 4 °C. Non-internalized, bound viral particles (arrowheads, blue) were also stained with a GP-specific antibody (green) and the plasma membrane with Alexa-594-wheat germ agglutinin (red) (top panels). To assess viral internalization, cells were heated to 37 °C (bottom panels). Internalized viral particles (blue puncta) are resistant to acid-stripping and inaccessible to a GP antibody.

Asterisk indicates below the limit of detection. d, Viral escape into the cytoplasm is blocked in HOPS-complex- and NPC1-deficient cells. Wild-type HAP1 cells treated with U18666A (10 μg ml−1) and the indicated mutant clones were infected with rVSV-G or rVSV-GP-EboV virus for 3 h and processed for VSV M staining (red).

Cathepsin L (CATL; also called CTSL1)-assisted cleavage of Ebola virus GP by CTSB is             required for viral membrane fusion 3 , 5 . Mutant HAP1 cells possess normal             CTSB/CATL activity ( Supplementary Fig. 14b, c ) and were fully             susceptible to mammalian reoviruses, which use CTSB or CATL for entry ( Supplementary Fig. 14d ). Moreover, these cells remained refractory to in                 vitro-cleaved rVSV-GP-EboV particles ( Fig. 3c ) that no             longer required CTSB/CATL activity within Vero cells ( Supplementary Fig.                 14a ). Therefore the HOPS complex and NPC1 are probably required downstream of the initial GP proteolytic processing steps that generate a primed entry             intermediate.
Finally, we used the intracellular distribution of the internal VSV M (matrix) protein as             a marker for membrane fusion ( Fig. 3d ). Cells were infected with             native VSV or rVSV-GP-EboV and immunostained to visualize the incoming M protein.             Endosomal acid-pH-dependent entry of either virus into wild-type HAP1 cells caused             redistribution of the incoming viral M throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig.                 3d and Supplementary Fig. 15a ). By contrast, only             punctate, perinuclear M staining was obtained in drug-treated and mutant cells infected             with rVSV-GP-EboV or rVSV-GP-MarV ( Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 15b ). Electron micrographs of mutant cells infected with             rVSV-GP-EboV revealed agglomerations of viral particles within vesicular compartments                 ( Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 16a )             containing LAMP1 ( Supplementary Fig. 16b ), indicating that fusion             and uncoating of incoming virus is arrested. Similarly, U18666A treatment increased the             number of viral particles in NPC1- and LAMP1-positive endosomes ( Supplementary Fig. 17 ). Therefore, NPC1 and the HOPS complex are required for             late step(s) in filovirus entry leading to viral membrane fusion and escape from the             lysosomal compartment.
We next tested if infection by authentic Ebola virus and Marburg virus is affected in NPC1-mutant primary patient fibroblasts. Yields of viral progeny were             profoundly reduced for both viruses in mutant cells ( Fig. 4a ).             Marked reductions in viral yield were also obtained in Vero cells treated with U18666A                 ( Fig. 4b ). Moreover U18666A greatly reduced infection of human             peripheral blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells and umbilical-vein endothelial cells             (HUVECs) ( Fig. 4c ), without affecting cell number or morphology                 ( Supplementary Fig. 19 ). Finally, knockdown of NPC1 in             HUVECs diminished infection by filoviruses ( Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 18 ). These findings indicate that NPC1 is critical             for authentic filovirus infection.

We assessed the effect of NPC1 mutation in lethal mouse models of Ebola virus and             Marburg virus infection. Heterozygous Npc1 (Npc1+/−) knockout mice and their wild-type             littermates were challenged with mouse-adapted Ebola virus or Marburg virus and             monitored for 28 days. Whereas Npc1+/+ mice rapidly             succumbed to infection with either filovirus, Npc1+/− mice were largely protected ( Fig. 4e ).
We have used global gene disruption in human cells to discover components of the unusual             entry pathway used by filoviruses. Most of the identified genes affect aspects of             lysosome function, indicating that filoviruses exploit this organelle differently from             all other viruses that we have tested ( Fig. 4f ). The unanticipated             role for the hereditary disease gene NPC1 in viral entry, infection and             pathogenesis may facilitate the development of antifilovirus therapeutics.
Methods Summary
Adherent HAP1 cells were generated by the introduction of OCT4/SOX2/Myc and KLF4                 transcription factors. 100 million cells were mutagenized using a retroviral                 gene-trap vector. Insertion sites were mapped for approximately 1% of the unselected                 population using parallel sequencing. Cells were infected with rVSV-GP-EboV and the                 resistant cell population was expanded. Genes that were statistically enriched for                 mutation events in the selected population were identified, and the roles of                 selected genes in filovirus entry were characterized.

Cells
KBM7 cells and derivatives were maintained in IMDM supplemented with 10% FCS, l-glutamine, and penicillin–streptomycin. Vero cells                         and primary human dermal fibroblasts (Coriell Institute for Medical                         Research) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, l-glutamine and penicillin–streptomycin. Wild-type and                         NPC1-null (CT43) Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts were maintained in                         DMEM-Ham’s F-12 medium (50-50 mix) supplemented with 10% FCS, l-glutamine and penicillin–streptomycin 30 .
To generate dendritic cells, primary human monocytes were cultured at                         37 °C, 5% CO2, and 80% humidity in RPMI                         supplemented with 10% human serum, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate,                         HEPES, penicillin–streptomycin, recombinant human granulocyte                         monocyte-colony stimulating factor                             (50 ng ml−1) and                         recombinant human interleukin-4                             (50 ng ml−1) for                         6 days. Cytokines were added every 2 days by replacing                         half of the culture volume with fresh culture media. Dendritic cells were                         collected on day 6, characterized by flow cytometry (see below) and used                         immediately. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained                         from Lonza and maintained in endothelial grown medium (EGM; Lonza).
HAP1 cells were used for the haploid screen and fibroblasts or CHO cells were                         used for hit validation and functional studies. Vero cells are commonly used                         in studies of filovirus replication, because they are highly susceptible to                         infection. Dendritic cell and HUVECs resemble cell types that are early and                         late targets of filovirus infection in vivo, respectively 31 , 32 .
Flow cytometry of dendritic cells
Human dendritic cells were treated with Fc-block (BD Pharmingen) before                         incubation with mouse anti-human CD11c-APC (BioLegend) and mouse anti-human                         CD209-PE or isotype controls. Dendritic cells were washed and re-suspended                         in PBS for flow cytometric analysis using a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer                         (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was completed using FlowJo software. >95% of cells were routinely observed to be CD11c+,                             DC-SIGN+.
Viruses
Recombinant VSV expressing eGFP and Ebola virus GP (rVSV-GP-EboV) was                         recovered and amplified as described 10 . Recombinant                         rVSV-GP-BDV was provided by J. C. de la Torre. rVSV-G-RABV was generated by                         replacement of the VSV G ORF in VSV-eGFP 33 with that of the                         SAD-B19 strain of rabies virus, and recombinant virus was recovered and                             amplified 34 . VSV pseudotypes bearing glycoproteins derived from Ebola virus, Sudan virus and Marburg virus were generated as                             described 35 .
The following non-recombinant viruses were used: adenovirus type 5 (ATCC),                         coxsackievirus B1 (ATCC), poliovirus 1 Mahoney (provided by C. Schlieker),                         HSV-1 KOS (provided by H. Ploegh), influenza A/PR8/34 (H1N1) (Charles                         Rivers), Rift valley fever virus MP-12 (provided by J. Wojcechowskyj), and                         mammalian reovirus serotype 1 (provided by M. Nibert).
Generation of HAP1 cells
Retroviruses encoding SOX2, MYC, OCT4 and KLF4 were produced 36 . Concentrated virus was used to infect near-haploid KBM7 cells in three                         consecutive rounds of spin-infection with an interval of 12 h.                         Colonies were picked and tested for ploidy. One clonally derived cell line                         (referred to as HAP1) was further grown and characterized. Karyotyping                         analysis demonstrated that most cells (27 of 39) were fully haploid, a                         smaller population (9 of 39) was haploid for all chromosomes except                         chromosome 8, like the parental KBM7 cells. Less than 10% (3 of 39) was diploid for all chromosomes except for chromosome 8, which was                         tetraploid.
Haploid genetic screen
Gene-trap virus was produced in 293T cells by transfection of pGT-GFP,                         pGT-GFP+1 and pGT-GFP+2 combined with pAdvantage, CMV-VSVG and Gag-pol. The                         virus was concentrated using ultracentrifugation for 1.5 h at                         25,000 r.p.m. in a Beckman SW28 rotor. 100 million HAP1 cells were infected.                         A proportion of the cells was harvested for genomic DNA isolation to create                         a control data set. For the screen, 100 million mutagenized cells were                         exposed to rVSV-GP-EboV at a MOI ∼100. The resistant colonies were                         expanded and ∼30 million cells were used for genomic DNA                         isolation.
Sequence analysis of gene-trap insertion sites
Insertion sites were identified by sequencing the genomic DNA flanking                         gene-trap proviral DNA as described before 8 . In short, a                         control data set was generated containing insertion sites in mutagenized                         HAP1 cells before selection with rVSV-GP-EboV. Genomic DNA was isolated from ∼40 million cells and subjected to a linear PCR followed by linker ligation, PCR and sequencing using the Genome Analyser platform (Illumina).                         Insertion sites were mapped to the human genome and insertion sites were                         identified that were located in Refseq genes. Insertions in this control                         data set comprise ∼400,000 independent insertions that meet this                         criteria ( Supplementary Table 1 ). To generate the                         experimental data set, insertions in the mutagenized HAP1 cells after                         selection with rVSV-GP-EboV were identified using an inverse PCR protocol                         followed by sequencing using the Genome Analyser. The number of inactivating                         mutations (that is, sense orientation or present in exon) per individual                         gene was counted as well as the total number of inactivating insertions for                         all genes. Enrichment of a gene in the screen was calculated by comparing                         how often that gene was mutated in the screen compared to how often the gene                         carries an insertion in the control data set. For each gene a P-value                         (corrected for false discovery rate) was calculated using the one-sided                         Fisher exact test ( Supplementary Table 2 ).
Characterization of the HAP1 mutant lines
Genomic DNA was isolated using Qiamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). To confirm that                         the cells were truly clonal and to confirm the absence of the wild-type DNA                         locus, a PCR was performed with primers flanking the insertion site using                         the following primers: (NPC-F1,                         5′-GAAGTTGGTCTGGCGATGGAG-3′; NPC1-R2,                         5′-AAGGTCCTGATCTAAAACTCTAG-3′; VPS33A-F1,                         5′-TGTCCTACGGCCGAGTGAACC-3′; VPS33A-R1,                         5′-CTGTACACTTTGCTCAGTTTCC-3′; VPS11-F1,                         5′-GAAGGAGCCGCTGAGCAATGATG-3′; VPS11-R1,                         5′-GGCCAGAATTTAGTAGCAGCAAC-3′). To confirm the correct                         insertion of the gene trap at the different loci a PCR was performed using                         the reverse (R1) primers of NPC1, VPS11 and VPS33A combined with a primer specific for the gene trap vector: PGT-F1;                         5′-TCTCCAAATCTCGGTGGAAC-3′. To determine RNA expression                         levels of NPC1, VPS11 and VPS33A, total RNA was reverse                         transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and amplified using                         gene-specific primers: VPS11,                         5′-CTGCTTCCAAGTTCCTTTGC-3′ and                         5′-AAGATTCGAGTGCAGAGTGG-3′; NPC1,                         5′-CCACAGCATGACCGCTC-3′ and                         5′-CAGCTCACAAAACAGGTTCAG-3′; VPS33A,                         5′-TTAACACCTCTTGCCACTCAG-3′ and                         5′-TGTGTCTTTCCTCGAATGCTG-3′.
Generation of stable cell populations expressing an                         NPC1–Flag fusion protein
A human cDNA encoding NPC1 (Origene) was ligated in-frame to a triple Flag                         sequence and the resulting gene encoding a C-terminally Flag-tagged NPC1                         protein was subcloned into the pBABE-puro retroviral vector 37 . Retroviral particles packaging the NPC1–Flag gene or no insert                         were generated by triple transfection in 293T cells, and used to infect                         control and NPC1-deficient human fibroblasts and CHO lines.                         Puromycin-resistant stable cell populations were generated.
Cell viability assays for virus treatments
KBM7 and HAP1 cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well tissue                         culture plates and treated with the indicated concentrations of                         rVSV-GP-EboV. After 3 days cell viability was measured using an                         XTT colorimetric assay (Roche). Viability is plotted as percentage viability                         compared to untreated control. To compare susceptibility of the HAP1 mutants                         to different viruses, they were seeded at 10,000 cells per well and treated                         with different cytolytic viruses at a concentration that in pilot                         experiments was the lowest concentration to produce extensive cytopathic                         effects. Three days after treatment, viable, adherent cells were fixed with                         4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with crystal                         violet.
VSV infectivity measurements
Infectivities of VSV pseudotypes were measured by manual counting of                         eGFP-positive cells using fluorescence microscopy at                         16–26 h after infection, as described previously 5 . rVSV-GP-EboV infectivity was measured by fluorescent-focus                         assay (FFA), as described previously 10 .
Filipin staining
Filipin staining to visualize intracellular cholesterol was done as                             described 38 . Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (3%)                         for 15 min at 25 ˚C. After three PBS washes,                         cells were incubated with filipin complex from Streptomyces                             filipinensis (Sigma-Aldrich)                             (50 μg ml−1) in                         the dark for 1 h at room temperature. After three PBS washes,                         cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy in the DAPI channel.
Measurements of cysteine cathepsin activity
Enzymatic activities of CTSB and CATL in acidified post-nuclear extracts of                         Vero cells, human fibroblasts and CHO lines were assayed with fluorogenic                         peptide substrates Z-Arg-Arg-AMC (Bachem Inc.) and (Z-Phe-Arg)2-R110                         (Invitrogen) as described 39 . As a control for assay                         specificity, enzyme activities were also assessed in extracts pre-treated                         with E-64 (10 μM), a broad-spectrum cysteine protease                         inhibitor, as previously described 10 . Active CTSB and CATL                         within intact cells were labelled with the fluorescently labelled                         activity-based probe GB111 (1 μM) and visualized by gel                         electrophoresis and fluorimaging, as described previously 40 .
Purification and dye conjugation of rVSV-GP-EboV
rVSV-GP-EboV was purified and labelled with Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular                         Probes, Invitrogen Corporation) as described 41 with minor                         modifications. Briefly, Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen                         Corporation) was solubilized in DMSO at                             10 mg ml−1 and incubated                         at a concentration of                             31.25 µg ml−1 with purified rVSV-GP-EboV                             (0.5 mg ml−1) in                         0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.3) for 90 min                         at room temperature. Virus was separated from free dye by                         ultracentrifugation. Labelled viruses were re-suspended in NTE                         (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl,                         1 mM EDTA) and stored at −80 °C.
Virus binding/internalization assay
Cells were inoculated with a MOI of 200–500 of Alexa-647-labelled                         rVSV-GP-EboV at 4 °C for 30 min to allow                         binding of virus to the cell surface. Cells were subsequently fixed in 2%                         paraformaldehyde (to examine virus binding) or after a 2-h incubation at                         37 °C and an acid wash to remove surface-bound virus. The                         cellular plasma membrane was labelled by incubation of cells with                             1 μg ml−1 Alexa                         Fluor 594 wheat germ agglutinin (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) in PBS for                         15 min at room temperature. External virus particles were                         detected using a 1:2,000 dilution of antibody 265.1, a mouse monoclonal                         antibody specific for Ebola GP. The GP antibodies were detected by                         Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes,                         Invitrogen). After washing with PBS, cells were mounted onto glass slides                         using Prolong Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes). Fluorescence                         was monitored with an epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl Zeiss)                         equipped with a ×63 objective and representative images were                         acquired using Slidebook 4.2 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) 41 , 42 .
VSV M protein-release assay
Cells grown on 12-mm coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine                         (Sigma-Aldrich) were pre-treated with                             5 μg ml−1 puromycin for 30 min and inoculated with rVSV at a MOI of                         200–500 in the presence of puromycin. After 3 h, cells                         were washed once with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for                         15 min at room temperature. To detect VSV M protein, fixed cells                         were incubated with a 1:7,500 dilution of monoclonal antibody 23H12 (gift of                         D. Lyles 43 ) in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100                         for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times                         with PBS, and the anti-M antibodies were detected using a 1:750 dilution of                         Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Cells were                         counter-stained with DAPI to visualize nuclei. Cells were washed three times                         and mounted onto glass slides after which M localization images were acquired using a Nikon TE2000-U inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon                         Instruments) equipped with a ×20 objective. Representative images                         were acquired with Metamorph software (Molecular Devices).
Electron microscopy
Confluent cell monolayers in 6-well plates were inoculated with rVSV-GP-EboV                         at a MOI of 200–500 for 3 h. Cells were fixed for at                         least 1 h at room temperature in a mixture of 2.5%                         glutaraldehyde, 1.25% paraformaldehyde and 0.03% picric acid in                         0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Samples were                         washed extensively in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer                         (pH 7.4) and treated with 1% osmiumtetroxide and 1.5%                         potassiumferrocyanide in water for 30 min at room temperature.                         Treated samples were washed in water, stained in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate                         for 30 min, and dehydrated in grades of alcohol (70%, 90%,                         2× 100%) for 5 min each. Cells were removed                         from the dish with propyleneoxide and pelleted at 3,000 r.p.m.                         for 3 min. Samples were infiltrated with Epon mixed with                         propyleneoxide (1:1) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were                         embedded in fresh Epon and left to polymerize for                         24–48 h at 65 °C. Ultrathin sections                         (about 60–80 nm) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut-S                         microtome and placed onto copper grids. For preparation of cryosections the                         virus-inoculated cells were rinsed once with PBS and removed from the dish                         with 0.5 mM EDTA in PBS. The cell suspension was layered on top                         of an 8% paraformaldehyde cushion in an Eppendorf tube and pelleted for                         3 min at 3,000 r.p.m. The supernatant was removed and                         fresh 4% paraformaldehyde was added. After 2 h incubation, the                         fixative was replaced with PBS. Before freezing in liquid nitrogen the cell                         pellets were infiltrated with 2.3 M sucrose in PBS for                         15 min. Frozen samples were sectioned at                         −120 °C and transferred to                         formvar-carbon-coated copper grids. Grids were stained for lysosomes with a                         mouse monoclonal antibody raised against LAMP1 (H4A3; Santa Cruz                         Biotechnology). The LAMP1 antibodies were visualized with Protein-A gold                         secondary antibodies. Contrasting/embedding of the labelled grids was                         carried out on ice in 0.3% uranyl acetate in 2% methyl cellulose. All grids                         were examined in a TecnaiG2 Spirit BioTWIN mission electron                         microscope and images were recorded with an AMT 2k CCD camera.
Authentic filoviruses and infections
Vero cells were pre-treated with culture medium lacking or containing U18666A                         (20 μM) for 1 h at 37 °C.                         VERO cells and primary human dermal fibroblasts were exposed to Ebola virus                         Zaire 1995 or Marburg virus Ci67 at a MOI of 0.1 for 1 h. Viral                         inoculum was removed and fresh culture media with or without drug was added.                         Samples of culture supernatants were collected and stored at                         −80 °C until plaque assays were completed.
Dendritic cells were collected and seeded in 96-well                         poly-d-lysine-coated black plates (Greiner Bio-One) at                             5 × 104 cells per well or                         in 6-well plates at 106 cells per well in culture media and                         incubated overnight at 37 °C. They were pre-treated with                         medium lacking or containing U18666A as described above. Dendritic cells                         were exposed to Ebola virus Zaire 1995 or Marburg virus Ci67 at a MOI of 3                         for 1 h. Virus inoculum was removed and fresh culture media with                         or without drug was added. Uninfected cells with or without drug served as                         negative controls. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and                         fixed with 10% formalin at designated times. HUVECs were seeded in 96-well                             poly-d-lysine-coated black plates at                             5 × 104 cells per well in                         culture media, treated with U18666A, infected, and processed as described                         above for dendritic cells.
Cytotoxicity analysis
Dendritic cells and HUVECs were seeded in 96-well plates. After overnight                         incubation at 37 °C, U18666A was added at the same                         concentrations used for the viral infection studies. Cells in culture media                         without drug served as the untreated control. At indicated times after                         treatment, an equal volume of CellTiter-Glo Reagent (Promega) was added to                         wells containing cells in culture media. Luminescence was measured using a                         plate reader.
Plaque assays for titration of filoviruses
Tenfold serial dilutions of culture supernatants or serum were prepared in                         modified Eagle’s medium with Earle’s balanced salts and                         nonessential amino acids (EMEM/NEAA) plus 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine                         serum. Each dilution was inoculated into a well of a 6-well plate containing                         confluent monolayers of Vero 76 cells. After adsorption for 1 h                         at 37 °C, monolayers were overlaid with a mixture of 1                         part of 1% agarose (Seakem) and 1 part of 2× Eagle basal medium                         (EBME), 30 mM HEPES buffer and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine                         serum. After incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 80%                         humidity for 6 days, a second overlay with 5% Neutral red was                         added. Plaques were counted the following day, and titres were expressed as                             p.f.u. ml−1.
Analysis of filovirus-infected cultures by                         immunofluorescence
Formalin-fixed cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin solution                         before incubation with primary antibodies. Ebola-virus-infected cells and                         uninfected controls were incubated with Ebola virus GP-specific monoclonal                         antibodies 13F6 (ref. 44 ) or KZ52 (ref. 45 ). Marburg-virus-infected cells and                         uninfected controls were incubated with Marburg virus GP-specific monoclonal                         antibody 9G4. Cells were washed with PBS before incubation with either goat                         anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-human IgG conjugated to Alexa 488. Cells were                         counterstained with Hoechst stain (Molecular Probes), washed with PBS and                         stored at 4 °C.
Image analysis
Images were acquired at 9 fields per well with a ×10 objective lens                         on a Discovery-1 high content imager (Molecular Devices) or at 6 fields per                         well with a ×20 objective lens on an Operetta (Perkin Elmer) high                         content device. Discovery-1 images were analysed with the                         ‘live/dead’ module in MetaXpress software. Operetta                         images were analysed with a customized scheme built from image analysis                         functions present in Harmony software.
Animals and filovirus challenge experiments
Mouse-adapted Ebola virus has been described 46 . Mouse-adapted                         Marburg virus Ci67 was provided by S. Bavari 47 . Female and                         male BALB/c Npc1+/− mice and BALB/c Npc1+/+ mice (5–8-week-old) were                         obtained from Jackson Laboratory. Mice were housed under specific                         pathogen-free conditions. Research was conducted in compliance with the                         Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations relating to                         animals and experiments involving animals and adhered to principles stated                         in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research                         Council, 1996). The facility where this research was conducted is fully                         accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of                         Laboratory Animal Care International. For infection, mice were inoculated                         intraperitoneally with a target dose of 1,000 p.f.u.                         (30,000× the 50% lethal dose) of mouse-adapted Ebola virus or                         mouse-adapted Marburg Ci67 virus in a biosafety level 4 laboratory. Mice                         were observed for 28 days after challenge by study personnel and                         by an impartial third party. Daily observations included evaluation of mice                         for clinical symptoms such as reduced grooming, ruffled fur, hunched                         posture, subdued response to stimulation, nasal discharge and bleeding.                         Serum was collected from surviving mice to confirm virus clearance. Back                         titration of the challenge dose by plaque assay determined that                         Ebola-virus-infected mice received 900 p.f.u. per mouse and                         Marburg-virus-infected mice received 700 p.f.u. per mouse.
RNA interference
Lentiviral vectors expressing an shRNA specific for NPC1 (Sigma-Aldrich; clone# TRCN0000005428; sequence CCACAAGTTCTATACCATATT) or a                         non-targeting control shRNA (Sigma-Aldrich; SHC002; sequence                         CAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAA) were packaged into HIV-1 pseudotype virus by                         transfection in HEK 293T cells and lentivirus-containing supernatants were                         harvested at 36 h and 48 h after transfection and                         centrifuged onto HUVECs in 12-well plates in the presence of                             6 μg ml−1 polybrene at 2,500 r.p.m., 25 °C for                         90 min. HepG2 cells were transduced as above but without the                         centrifugation step. Cells were subjected to puromycin selection                         24 h after the last lentiviral transduction (HepG2,                             1 µg ml−1;                         HUVECs, 1.5 μg ml−1)                         for 48–72 h before harvest for experiments. The level                         of NPC1 knockdown was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of                         cell extracts and immunoblotting with an anti-NPC1 polyclonal antibody                         (Abcam).
Ebola virus replicon assay
Ebola virus support plasmids were created by cloning the NP, VP35, VP30 and L genes from cDNA (provided by E.                             Mühlberger 48 ) into pGEM3 (Promega) and the                         mutant pL-D742A plasmid was generated by QuikChange site-directed                         mutagenesis (Stratagene). Truncated versions of the Ebola virus non-coding                         sequence were generated by overlap-extension PCR and appended to the eGFP ORF. The replicon pZEm was prepared as described                             previously 49 . The replicon RNA sequence is flanked on the                         5′ end by a truncated T7 promoter with a single guanosine                         nucleotide and on the 3′ end by the HDV ribozyme sequence and T7                         terminator. The transcribed replicon RNA consists of the following EboV                         Zaire sequences (GenBank accession AF086833):                         [5′]-single guanosine                         nucleotide–176-nucleotide genomic 5′                         terminus–55-nucleotide L mRNA 3′                             UTR–eGFP ORF (antisense                         orientation)–100-nucleotide NP mRNA 5′                         UTR–155-nucleotide genomic 3′                         terminus-[3′]. The viral replicon assay was                         performed as described previously 49 except that U18666A                             (20 μg ml−1) was                         included in the supplemented DMEM where indicated. Images were collected                         directly from 6-cm dishes with a Zeiss Axioplan inverted fluorescent                         microscope.

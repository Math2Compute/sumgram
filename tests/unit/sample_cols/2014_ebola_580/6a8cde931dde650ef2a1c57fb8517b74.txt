Audio PSA from First Lady of Guinea, Hadja Djene Kaba Condé
Washing hands well can help protect yourself and your family from Ebola and also other diseases. Ebola is a very serious disease. But it is possible to survive and heal with proper medical treatment. If you or someone you know thinks he has the disease, go to the hospital immediately for treatment. This is your best chance of surviving the disease and also to protect the people around you so they do not contract Ebola. Do not risk your life or that of your family and loved ones. If you think you have ebola, go to the hospital right away.
PSAs for West African Communities in the U.S.
PSA #1: Preparing for a visit with family or friends traveling from West Africa
Will your family or friends from West Africa be visiting soon? Learn about Ebola.
Message 1: Learn about the risk of exposure.
People can only be exposed to Ebola if they have contact with blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola without wearing the right protective clothing. Body fluids include urine, sweat, saliva, feces, vomit, and semen. Ebola is not spread through air or water or, in general, through food; however, in Africa, Ebola may be spread through preparing bushmeat or having contact with infected animals.
If any of your friends or family members traveled from West Africa and were exposed to Ebola, call a doctor, even if they don’t have symptoms.
Countries in West Africa are working to make sure that people who have Ebola or have been exposed to Ebola don’t get on airplanes. Make sure your friends and family who are planning to visit know that they shouldn’t fly if they are sick or have been exposed within the previous 21 days.

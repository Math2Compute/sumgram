Ebola and C4D

What exactly is the Ebola disease? How does it spread? And what can you do to help fight it?
 
The spread of Ebola in West Africa has slowed dramatically, but the challenges remain huge in defeating this scourge while re-establishing basic social services and building resilience in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The outbreak has been unprecedented in scope and intensity, and hit some of the most vulnerable communities in some of the worldâs poorest countries. Millions of children have been affected in some way or other -- falling victim to the deadly virus, becoming orphans, facing stigmatization, losing months of school education, and being traumatized.
International solidarity remains essential in the immediate response and in helping address the conditions â particularly weak health systems and deficient sanitation â that enabled a localized epidemic to escalate into a major crisis. Helping the affected countries build back better will mean theyâll be better equipped to prevent another such an outbreak and to tackle other killer diseases â such as malaria, measles, pneumonia and diarrhoea â that take a heavy toll on children.
Communication for development (C4D) is especially necessary in this crisis because containing the outbreak requires a shift in the rituals and activities of entire populations. Spreading knowledge and information requires a range of communication tools to be effective and UNICEFâs C4D team is well placed to help with this work on the ground in the countries hardest hit.
Engaging in and with communities is the primary way to help individuals and families protect themselves, care for and transport the sick, and enable those appointed to safely bury the dead.

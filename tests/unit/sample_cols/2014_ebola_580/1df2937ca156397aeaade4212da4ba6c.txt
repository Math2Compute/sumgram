FIG 8
Proposed model of regulation of VP35 function by ubiquitination. Upon virus recognition of EBOV infection, pattern recognition                            receptor (PRR) signaling promotes the synthesis of unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin chains by the E3-ubiquitin ligase TRIM6.                            These polyubiquitin chains interact with IKKε and induce its oligomerization and downstream signaling to produce IFN-β ( 44 ). VP35 inhibits IFN-β at the level of RIG-I and the kinases TBK1 and IKKε ( 20 ). Ubiquitination of VP35 by TRIM6 promotes VP35-mediated polymerase activity and enhances virus replication.
In summary, here we report a new function for the host E3-ubqiuitin ligase TRIM6 in promoting Ebola virus replication. We                      propose that the VP35 protein of Ebola virus hijacks TRIM6 to promote virus replication via ubiquitination ( Fig. 8 ). Therefore, TRIM6 is emerging as a critical host factor targeted by multiple viruses to enhance their replication.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and viruses.HEK-293T, HeLa, A549, Vero E6 (CRL1586), and Vero (CCL-81) cells all were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection                         (ATCC). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),                         2 mM l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco-BRL). Wild-type Ebola virus (EBOV) strain Zaire and recombinant EBOV expressing                         GFP (kindly provided by the Special Pathogens Branch, CDC, Atlanta, GA) were propagated in Vero E6 cells. Stock virus titers                         were determined by plaque assay in Vero-CCL81 cells. All work with live virus was carried out under biosafety level 4 (BSL4)                         conditions in the Robert E. Shope biosafety level 4 laboratory, UTMB. Sendai virus (SeV; Cantell strain) was obtained from                         Charles River Laboratories and propagated in 10-day-old pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories,                         North Franklin, CT).
Plasmids and reagents.The VP35 WT (untagged or Flag-tagged), VP35 K309A mutant, and TRIM6 and ubiquitin expression constructs have been described                         before ( 11 , 44 ). The RIG-I (2CARD) expression constructs as well as pIFNβ fLuc reporters were kindly provided by A. Garcia-Sastre (Icahn                         School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) and have been described previously ( 43 , 44 ). The reporter plasmid carrying the Renilla luciferase gene (REN-Luc/pRL-TK) was purchased from Promega. The HA-TRIM6 plasmid was kindly provided by Andrea Ballabio                         ( 51 ). All sequences were confirmed by sequencing analysis at the UTMB molecular genomics core facility.
Transient transfections were performed with TransIT-LT1 (Mirus), Lipofectamine 2000, or RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to                         the manufacturers' instructions. Mouse anti-VP35 antibody has been described previously ( 18 , 46 ). Mouse and rabbit anti-FLAG antibodies, rabbit anti-HA antibody, mouse anti-β-tubulin, and mouse anti-β-actin antibodies                         were from Sigma. Rabbit monoclonal anti-ubiquitin lysine 48 (K48, clone Apu2) was purchased from Millipore. Rabbit anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody (OTI4G1) was from Bethyl Laboratories. Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for imaging                         Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 555 donkey                         anti-rabbit, and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 633 were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Life Technologies). Directly conjugated                         antibodies toward Flag/DYKDDDK tag for rabbit (Alexa 555) and HA tag for mouse (Alexa 488) were from Thermo Scientific and                         Cell Signaling Technologies.
Ebola virus infections.WT and KO A549 cells were seeded into 24-well plates 18 to 24 h prior to infection in complete medium (DMEM, 10% heat-inactivated                         FBS [HI-FBS], 1% penicillin-streptomycin [PS]). At 80% confluence, growth medium was removed and EBOV-GFP (or WT EBOV) was                         added at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI). Cells were returned to a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 1 h and rocked every 15 min. Following a 1-h incubation, the inoculum was removed and the cells                         washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and returned to the incubator with viral growth medium (DMEM, 2% HI-FBS,                         1% PS). Growth medium for titration was removed at the indicated time point and the monolayer lysed using TRIzol reagent for                         RNA extraction. Titers of samples were determined on Vero CCL-81 cells in 12-well plates by standard protocols. Briefly, log                         dilutions of virus were added to 80% confluent monolayers and rocked every 15 min for infection of A549. At 1 h postinfection,                         cells were overlaid with a semisolid overlay of MEM, 0.5% methylcellulose, 2% HI-FBS, and 1% PS. Ten days postinfection, the                         overlay was removed and monolayers were stained and fixed using 10% neutral buffered formalin with crystal violet. Plaques                         were enumerated and virus titers, as PFU per milliliter, were calculated.
Luciferase reporter assays.HEK293T cells were transfected in 24-well (5 × 104 cells per well) or 96-well (1 × 104 cells per well) plates (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, NJ) with 10 to 50 ng of IFN-β reporter plasmid, 4 to 20 ng of Renilla luciferase, and 2 to 50 ng plasmids using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) at a ratio of 1:3. Empty vector was used to ensure that the                         plasmid concentration in each well was the same. Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed and Dual-Luciferase assay was performed                         according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Values were obtained by normalizing the luciferase                         values by Renilla values (fLuc/rLuc) and then normalized to the nonstimulated sample to obtain fold induction.
Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting.Transfected 293T cells were harvested in RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (vol/vol) NP-40,                         0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and supplemented with 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)                         and iodoacetamide as deubiquitinase inhibitors. Cell lysate was clarified by microcentrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min.                         One-tenth of the aliquot from clarified lysate was taken and added to 2× Laemmli buffer with β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) and                         stored at −20°C for Western blotting (whole-cell extracts [WCE]). Mouse anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody cross-linked to agarose beads (EZview Red Anti-FLAG M2 or EZview Red Anti-HA affinity gel; Sigma) were added to the rest of the lysate, and the mixture                         was rotated on a benchtop shaker overnight at 4°C. Beads were extensively washed, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling                         for 10 min in Laemmli loading buffer. For immunoblotting, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5% or 4 to 15%; Bio-Rad) and                         transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon; Bio-Rad Laboratories). The following primary antibodies                         were used: anti-Ub-K48 (1:1,000), anti-Flag (1:3,000) (Sigma), anti-HA (1:5,000) (Sigma), anti-GST (1:2,000) (Bethyl Laboratories),                         and anti-actin/tubulin (1:5,000).
Immunoblots (IB) were developed with the following secondary antibodies: ECL anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated                         whole antibody from donkey and ECL anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated whole antibody from sheep (GE Healthcare,                         Buckinghamshire, England). The proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce).
Denaturing pulldown of ubiquitinated VP35.HEK293T cells were transfected with His-tagged Ub and VP35. After 30 h, cells were harvested in RIPA lysis buffer supplemented                         with protease inhibitor cocktail and 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and iodoacetamide as deubiquitinase inhibitors. Cell lysate                         was clarified by microcentrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. One-tenth of the aliquot from clarified lysate was taken and                         added to 2× Laemmli buffer with β-ME and stored at −20°C for Western blotting (input). The rest of the lysate was bound to                         nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) beads (Qiagen) overnight at 4°C in a shaker. The next day, beads were extensively washed                         with either RIPA buffer (nondenaturing pulldown) or with a denaturing buffer containing 6 M urea, 350 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40,                         40 mM imidazole in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0). After 7 washes, the bound ubiquitinated proteins were eluted on the rotator in a cold                         room for 30 min in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM imidazole. Protein eluates were mixed with Laemmli loading buffer                         and analyzed by immunoblotting.
Quantitative PCR.qPCR was performed as previously described ( 44 ). In brief, total RNA was extracted from A549 cells with TRIzol reagent (Sigma) and purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).                         cDNA was prepared by using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by following the manufacturer's                         instructions. Relative gene expression was determined by using SYBR green mix (Bio-Rad) with a Bio-Rad CFX384 instrument.                         CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad) was used to analyze the relative mRNA expression levels by the change in the threshold cycle                         (ΔCT) and normalized using the 18S gene as the housekeeping gene.
Immunofluorescence microscopy and image analysis.For colocalization studies of HA-TRIM6 and Flag-VP35, HeLa cells were seeded into Lab-Tek II 8-well chamber slides (CC2 glass                         slide; Nunc, Rochester, NY). After 12 to 16 h, 300 to 700 ng of plasmids was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)                         at a ratio of 1:1. Six hours later, medium was replaced, and 16 to 24 h later, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,                         permeabilized with 0.5% (vol/vol) NP-40 in PBS, and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.2% fish gelatin in                         PBS for 1 h (blocking solution). Staining was performed with anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies (1:200) (prepared in blocking                         solution) overnight at 4°C. The next day, cells were washed 3 times with blocking solution, and the secondary antibodies donkey                         anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen), diluted in blocking buffer along with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole                         (DAPI) (1:3,000), were used to visualize the proteins. The slides were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope in the                         UTMB optical imaging core at a magnification of ×63.
Ebola minigenome polymerase assay.A functional polymerase complex was reconstituted by transfection of plasmids expressing L (500 ng), NP (250 ng), VP30 (100                         ng), and model viral RNA encoding the Renilla reporter flanked by viral regulatory sequences (200 ng) with or without VP35 (25 ng or 125 ng) and T7 polymerase (200 ng)                         into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagent. A firefly plasmid (10 ng) is also coexpressed                         to determine transfection efficiency. Plasmids encoding HA-TRIM6 or HA-TRIM6 C15A were also cotransfected as indicated in                         the figure. The plasmid amounts are indicative of one well of a 12-well plate, and the reaction is divided into 4 wells of                         a 96-well plate with 100,000 cells/well, where three replicates were used for minigenome assay and one replicate was used                         for Western blotting. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, the luciferase activities were determined using Dual Glo reagent                         (Promega) and reading on an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). The Renilla activity was normalized with firefly activity, and fold increase was calculated by setting the no-VP35 value as 1. Note that                         TRIM6 and VP35 plasmid concentrations need to be carefully titrated to allow an experimental window for enhancement upon TRIM6                         coexpression. A limited amount of VP35 (25 ng) was selected after titrations. The levels of protein expression were validated                         by immunoblotting. All of the minigenome helper plasmids are in pCAGGS and MG-Reporter reporter plasmid in pTM1.
Mass spectrometry analysis.To identify ubiquitinated sites on EBOV VP35, we first enriched for ubiquitinated proteins by co-IP. HEK293T cells were transfected                         with 500 ng of HA-Ub and 500 ng of EBOV VP35 expression vector. Thirty hours posttransfection, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer                         and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-HA beads. After extensive washes, ubiquitinated proteins, including VP35,                         were eluted using HA peptide (Sigma). Ubiquitinated protein eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and gel bands at or above                         the molecular mass of VP35 (35 to 82 kDa) were excised. Gel slices were digested in-gel with trypsin for liquid chromatography-tandem                         MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis ( 59 ). Following digestion, samples were concentrated using C18 ZipTips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Desalted samples were evaporated to dryness and resuspended                         in 0.1% formic acid for mass spectrometry analysis. Digested peptide mixtures were analyzed in technical duplicate on a Thermo                         Scientific LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometry system equipped with a Proxeon Easy nLC 1000 ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography                         and autosampler system (laboratory of J. R. Johnson and N. J. Krogan at UCSF). Samples were injected onto a C18 column (25 cm by 75 μm inner diameter, packed with ReproSil Pur C18 AQ 1.9-μm particles) in 0.1% formic acid and then subjected to a 2-h gradient from 0.1% formic acid to 30% ACN–0.1% formic                         acid. The mass spectrometer collected data in a data-dependent fashion, collecting one full scan in the Orbitrap at 120,000                         resolution followed by 20 collision-induced dissociation MS/MS scans in the dual linear ion trap for the 20 most intense peaks                         from the full scan. Dynamic exclusion was enabled for 30 s with a repeat count of 1. Charge state screening was employed to                         reject analysis of singly charged species or species for which a charge could not be assigned.
Raw mass spectrometry data were searched with the Protein Prospector algorithm ( 60 ) against the VP35 sequence with a precursor charge state range of 2 to 4, monoisotopic parent mass tolerance of ±20 ppm,                         fragment ion mass tolerance of ±0.8 Da, constant modification for cysteine carbamidomethylation, and variable modifications                         for N-terminal protein acetylation, methionine oxidation, peptide N-terminal glutamine-to-pyroglutamine conversion, protein                         N-terminal methionine cleavage, and lysine ubiquitin remnant (diGly) modification to identify trypsin-digested ubiquitination                         sites. Data were filtered with a minimum peptide score of 15.0 and a maximum peptide E value of 0.05.
Generation of A549 TRIM6 CRISPR/Cas9 knockout.The TRIM6 knockout cell lines were generated using a CRISPR-CAS9 vector, (pSpCas9n)(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) (Addgene plasmid 48138),                         with an single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting exon 2 of the human TRIM6 gene (target sequence, ACTGGTGGACATACGAGAAG). Sequences                         were designed using the following link: http://crispr.mit.edu:8079/ . The sgRNA sequence was cloned into the CRISPR-Cas9 vector as described by Ran et al. ( 61 ). To generate the knockout cell line, 5 × 105 A549 cells (ATCC) were seeded in a 6-well plate and transfected with 2 μg of CRISPR-CAS9 vector in 500 μl of Opti-MEM and                         1.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. Medium was changed 6 h later. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, cells were observed for GFP                         expression, trypsinized to a single-cell suspension, passed through a 70-μm strainer, and sorted by flow cytometry using a                         BD FACSAria2 (core facility at UTMB) for stable GFP expression. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h. To generate stably                         modified clones, cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting according to a desired florescence level were diluted                         to 2.5 cells/ml, and 200 μl of cells was plated to 96-well plates and expanded to clonal cell lines. Knockout lines were verified                         by Western blotting. Transfections of these A549 WT and TRIM6 KO cells was performed in 6-well plates with 1 × 105 cells per well (in triplicate wells). Cells were allowed to attached to the plates overnight, and transfections were then                         performed using 1 μg of VP35 plasmid and Lipofectamine LTX (ThermoFisher) by following the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight                         hours posttransfection, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer and the triplicate wells were combined to obtain enough express                         protein for detection in co-IP assays.
Statistical analysis.Statistical analysis was performed with Prism (version 5.0; GraphPad Software). Student's paired t test or one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple-comparison test was used: *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001; and NS (not significant).

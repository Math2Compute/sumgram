TMA Hot Topics Bibliography: Infection Control in the Outpatient Setting  
Physicians and other health professionals can access a recording of a  webinar  hosted by the HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and CDC on Ebola preparedness for the U.S. health care system. The webinar focuses on the  Detailed Hospital Checklist for Ebola Preparedness , which highlights the activities all hospitals can take to prepare for the possibility of a patient exposed to Ebola arriving for medical care. CDC says hospital emergency managers, infection control        officers, hospital leaders, and clinical staff will find the information particularly valuable. The checklist provides practical and specific suggestions to ensure hospitals can detect possible Ebola cases, protect their employees, and respond appropriately.

Ebola Zaire Outbreaks
1972. Retrospective Serologic Identification
In February 1977, serum from medical personnel who could have come in contact      with Ebola were tested for Ebola antibodies. The serum from a Tandala Hospital      physician tested positive. In May of 1972, this physician had lacerated his      finger while performing an autopsy on a Zairois bible school student. The      student died of a hemorrhagic illness that was clinically diagnosed as yellow      fever. The physician became ill 12 days after lacerating his finger. In 1977,      his hospital records were reviewed, and his symptoms were characteristic of      Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever.

1976. Yambuku, Zaire.
EBO-Z surfaced shortly after the first Ebola outbreak in Sudan and killed      280 of the 318 people it infected. On September 1, 1976, four days after returning      from a tour of northern Zaire, the index case, a 44 year-old male teacher      at the Mission School, sought medical intervention for a febrile illness he      thought to be malaria. He received a parenteral injection of chloroquine (an      anti-malaria drug) from Yambuku Mission Hospital (YMH). YMH did not use disposable      needles or sterilize the needles between uses. Parenteral injection was the      primary mode of administering nearly all medicines, and Ebola-Zaire (EBO-Z)      was quickly disseminated into the surrounding villages serviced by YMH. After      11 of its 17 staff members fell ill with EHF, YMH closed on September 30,      1976, 29 days after the index case received his injection of chloroquine.      The WHO International Commission was formed on October 18th, and research      teams were mobilized on October 30th. The last case of EBO-Z died on November      5, 1976. Transmission of Ebola during this outbreak occurred mainly through      the use of contaminated needles to administer medicine.

1977. Tandala, Zaire.
In June of 1977, a 9 year-old girl with a 3 day history of      fever, abdominal pain, and hematemesis (the vomiting of blood) was admitted      to Tandala Mission Hospital. Prior to her admission to the hospital, she lived      with her family in a small village, Bonduni, 20 km      from the mission was in good health and had not traveled outside of the Bonduni      area. When she was admitted to the hospital, she had a 39.5°C body temperature (normal body temperature is 37&degC) and after physical examination,      she had a clinical diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever. 28 hours after admission      to the Tandala Mission Hospital, she lost consciousness and died. None of      her family members tested positive for Ebola antibodies.

1994. Minkebe and Makokou, Gabon.
This epidemic began in December 1994 and had two different waves of patients      (December 1994 and January-February 1995).
First Wave, December 1994
All of the cases in were from 3 gold-panning encampments (Andock, Mékouka,      and Minkébé) located in small forest clearings (2000-3000m²)      bordering the rain forest. This region of Gabon is sparsely populated; a total      of 350 people live in these three villages (20 in Andock, 30 in Mékouka,      and 300 in Minkébé). 32 people from the 3 forest encampments      contracted EHF (4 from Andock, 23 from Mékouka, and 5 from Minkébé)      and traveled 100 km south via boat to Mekouka General Hospital for medical      treatment.
Second Wave, End of December 1994 to February 1995
The patients that comprised the "second wave" were secondary or tertiary cases      from the first wave and did not originate from the encampments. The first      case in the second wave, end of December 1994, was from a small village near      Makokou that was far from the encampments, Mayela. This person lived near      a traditional healer, "nganga," and probably was infected from contact      with a hospitalized patient who sought the medical help of a nganga. In mid      January, 16 additional cases occurred near the road that runs south towards      Fanceville (one case at Makokou General Hospital, 12 cases from Mayela, one      case from Ekatiabe, and two cases from Ekobakoba). None of these 16 patients      had been in the area affected by the first wave of the EBO epidemic in Gabon      (Mékouka, Andock, and Minkébé) during the previous three      months. All 16 patients had been either in direct contact with ill relatives      (patients hospitalized at Makokou General Hospital or sleeping in the nganga's      home) or with people caring for patients. The last reported case occurred      at Ekobakoba on February 9, 1995 and was infected with Ebola while caring      for an ill relative at Makokou General Hospital. The Gabonese health officials      declared the epidemic officially over on 17 February 1995. The Gabonese authorities      declared the epidemic over only eight days after the last case, leaving time      for additional infections to occur. In previous Ebola outbreaks, an outbreak      was not declared over until a period of 42 days (twice the longest incubation      period) has lapsed since the last known infection.
Overall, 49 people were admitted to Makokou General Hospital with suspected      HF between December 1994 and February 1995 during these two waves. 29 of the      49 patients had fatal cases of EHF (case fatality rate of 59%). 26 of the      EHF patients were male and 23 were female. The mean age of the patients was      37. Whether the number of infected people reflects the true number of EHF      cases during this epidemic is not known. Some of the patients who were admitted      with suspected EHF could have had a different type of HF or a different disease      all together. Some cases who did have EHF could have sought the care of a      nganga without seeking hospital care or could have died in their village or      in the bush without the EHF investigative team being informed.
The exact origin of the virus during this epidemic is unknown. During this      outbreak, there was more than one point of contact with Ebola. This led to      a longer duration of the epidemic than if there was only one point of contact      with Ebola (as in the Spring 1996 outbreak; see below).

On January 6, 1995 the first EHF case-patient, "GM", had the onset        of illness and was admitted to Kikwit General Hospital. He was a 42-year-old        male charcoal worker, a Seventh-Day Adventist and had not eaten monkey meat        or been in detectable contact with another EHF case-patient prior to becoming        ill with EHF (1, 10). His charcoal plot was on the edge of a dense        forest and under a dense forest canopy. During his woodcutting forays and        charcoal burning pit diggings, he was exposed to a wide array of possible        vectors and, presumably, the natural reservoir (1). He directly,        fatally infected at least three members of his family and an additional        10 members of his extended family over a period of 9 weeks and an area encompassing        Kikwit and three surrounding villages. Some of the ill people from this        family and secondary and tertiary cases in other families who provided nursing        care or who had participated in the ritual burials of GM's family went to        Kikwit II Maternity Hospital (10).
On April 9, a 36 year-old male laboratory technician who worked at Kikwit        II Maternity Hospital went to the Kikwit General Hospital, Zaire because        of fever and bloody diarrhea. Suspecting a perforated bowel from typhoid,        he underwent surgery on April 10 and 11 (10). He died four days after        the onset of symptoms. On April 14, the medical personnel who cared for        the laboratory worker in the operating theater or hospital wards became        ill with fever, headache, back, joint, and muscle aches, extreme asthenia        (clinical definition for physical weakness), and, in some cases, hemorrhagic        manifestations. Over 70% of the first generation cases were hospital personnel.        One of the ill people who had provided care for the laboratory technician        was transferred to a hospital in Mosango (75 miles west of Kikwit). Some        of the people who had provided care for this individual developed similar        symptoms on approximately April 20 . 10 days after the first-generation        cases, a second generation of cases occurred among family and friends of        the first-generation cases. Transmission during this outbreak was mainly        person-to-person through contact with bodily fluids and ritual cleansing        of bodies before burial (usually performed by women). To limit the spread        of EHF, the Zairian government closed all schools in Kikwit. The Kinshasa        airport remained open during most of the outbreak (5, 7, 8).
The unusual nature of the laboratory technician's death and the medical        personnel who cared for him prompted a local ad hoc committee to meet to        discuss the nature of these deaths. J.J. Muyembe-Tamfun, Ministry of Health,        Zaire, who had participated in the follow-up of the 1976 outbreak of Ebola-Zaire        in Zaire (for information about that outbreak, please see 1976 Zaire above)        suggested that these illnesses may be caused by a viral hemorrhagic fever.        On his prompting, specimens were obtained for analysis and were sent to        the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium on May 4th. On May        9th the CDC received portions of these samples for confirmational diagnostic        analysis. The CDC confirmed EBO as the etiologic agent responsible for the        disease in all 14 patients (the index patient and the medical personnel        who subsequently contracted it nosocomially from him) (10).
Based on the preliminary findings of the Institute for Tropical Medicine,        on May 6, 1995, the Zairian government sought the assistance of the CDC        with an outbreak of a viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF)-like illness that was        occurring in Kikwit, Zaire. The population of Zaire in 1995 was approximately        400,000. Kikwit is located approximately 240 miles east of Kinshasa. The        CDC's and the WHO's investigation of this outbreak was primarily retrospective        (6).
Four separate hospitals were implicated in the outbreak. The first hospital        and the center of the outbreak was Kikwit General Hospital (the hospital        that treated the laboratory technician). The second was Kikwit II Hospital.        The third was the hospital in Mosango, where one of the medical personnel        who cared for the laboratory technician was transferred. The fourth hospital        was in Yassa Bonga, approximately 250 km. from Kikwit (8).

The last identified case of EHF during this outbreak was a 27-year-old housewife        from Nzinda, Kikwit. She was admitted to Kikwit II Maternity Hospital on        24 June 1995 for the management of a septic abortion. She was discharged        on July 14 and died at home on July 16 (10). On August 24, 1995,        the 1995 outbreak was declared over, twice the maximum known incubation        period (42 days, 21x2) lapsed without any new cases of EHF(1).
More than 1400 samples of different fauna were collected for reservoir testing        (4).
Overall, there were 315 cases, 244 of which were fatal (77% case fatality        rate). 166 cases were female and 149 were male. 123 female cases were fatal        (74% fatal) and 121 male cases were fatal (81% fatal). The cases of EHF        ranged from three days to 71 years, with a mean age of 35 years. 26 of the        EHF cases were less than 17 years old and 13 were over 60. Median age of        the survivors was 29 years; median age of the fatal cases was 35 years.        Of the 286 cases where the professional occupations were known, 90 (32%)        were health care workers and 61 (21%) were housewives (usually nursed sick        or performed the ritual cleansing and burial preparation practices for dead        family members). Approximately 73% of the first 70 patients in the epidemic        were medical personnel, and the case fatality rate among them was high (1,        6, 9).
266 of the EHF cases were reported to have lived in Kikwit North and South Zones de Sante, the remaining in the Zones de Sante of Bulungu        (13 cases), Feshi (1), Gungu (4), Idiofa (1), Mosango (23), Mokala (1),        and Vanga (6). All of the cases of EHF were in the Kikwit and Kwilu administrative        Sub-Regions, except for 1 case in the Kwango Sub-Region, Bandundu Region.        None of the cases were acquired outside of the Bandundu Region (1).

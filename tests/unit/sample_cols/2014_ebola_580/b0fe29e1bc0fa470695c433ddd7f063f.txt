Daniela Steuermann in Sierra Leone
August 11, 2016
"My life has changed greatly in the past year. Of course I do without many things in life, and the hardest thing for me is the distance from my friends and family. But I get so much back. For one thing, of course, the work is very different from my life as a nurse at a German hospital. My work in the project is more diverse, and I have more responsibility and autonomy, which I really appreciate."

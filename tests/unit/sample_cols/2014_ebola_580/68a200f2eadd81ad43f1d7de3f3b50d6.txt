Discussion
There is an urgent need for a cost-effective postexposure therapeutic to treat infection and halt transmission during EBOV                               outbreaks, as well as for use in the event of a bioterror threat. The importance of antibodies in the adaptive immune response                               during vaccination is well recognized, and the use of antibodies as therapeutics against infectious disease is building credibility                               as well ( 6 , 28 , 29 ). It is only recently, however, that passive immunization for EBOV—with macaque polyclonal IgG and with mouse mAbs—has been                               demonstrated ( 20 , 21 ). The results presented here further extend these findings to a mixture of mAbs appropriate for human administration. The                               evaluation of protection using MB-003 in the macaque model shows a system in which both the pathogenesis of disease and immune                               responses of the animal host imitate the human condition. The mixture of three mAbs in a postexposure treatment regimen against                               EBOV was designed to mimic a potential needle-stick scenario in a laboratory setting.
Although involving small numbers, the results from the first two pilot studies were informative. In the first study, MB-003CHO protected the two treated animals from a lethal 100 pfu challenge. These animals were completely protected from morbidity,                               in contrast to the two controls that displayed clinical illness and succumbed to infection. In the second experiment, MB-003                               from the CHO and RAMP system were compared, using a more rigorous challenge of 1,000 pfu. Results from this experiment are                               confounded by the survival of the control, which has occurred one other time in the last 2 y with this viral stock (of 15                               animals total; given the likely genetic diversity of these wild-caught macaques, it is not entirely surprising that controls                               occasionally can survive, as do humans, perhaps due to differences in CD4+, CD8+, or IFN-γ responses) ( 30 ). Nevertheless, the control did show symptoms of infection and viremia. The protection conferred by MB-003RAMP (three of three protected; P < 0.02 compared with historical controls), administered at one-third of the dose of MB-003CHO–treated animals (one of two protected), is consistent with our findings in mice that the RAMP-derived mAbs have superior                               potency ( 22 ). Because the only difference between the CHO and RAMP mAbs is their glycosylation, this would suggest a significant role                               for glycan-dependent Fc receptor-mediated effector functions in the protection conferred by these mAbs. Indeed, the absence                               of core fucose on IgG1 is known to increase binding of mAb to FcγRIII, resulting in a dramatic improvement in ADCC activity compared with antibody                               with core fucose. These results in total suggest that ADCC plays a critical role in the protective efficacy conferred by the                               MB-003 mAbs. It is interesting to speculate whether the incomplete or absence of protection previously observed with polyclonal                               and monoclonal antibodies of high neutralizing activity ( 17 ⇓ – 19 , 31 ) may have been due to relatively reduced ADCC activity conferred by their glycosylation—CHO cells, and mammalian cells in                               general, produce only a small percentage of IgG lacking core fucose.
In our final experiment, four of six animals treated 1 or 2 d p.i. with MB-003RAMP survived challenge with a historically 100% lethal viral stock (n = 6), whereas both controls died. The two treated animals that succumbed to challenge experienced either hindered or delayed                               course of disease. Because c13C6 and c6D8 neutralize EBOV in the presence of complement ( 14 ), the inability to detect virus in serum by plaque assay in these two animals ( Fig. 3F ), even when significant levels of viral RNA were detected by RT-PCR ( Fig. 3E ), suggests these animals did not succumb to escape mutants. Further, EBOV GP-specific ELISA showed that the animals had high                               levels of antibody ( Fig. 2B ) through the entire study, indicating that mAb was not consumed by viral replication as reported by Marzi et al. ( 18 ). The four treated animals that survived challenge experienced little to no viremia and had few, if any, of the clinical                               symptoms observed in the two controls. With a caveat that direct comparisons between studies performed in different laboratories                               are difficult, this is in contrast to the course of disease seen in survivors treated with other EBOV therapeutic candidates                               in advanced development (siRNA, PMOs, and VSV) in which surviving animals experience varying levels of morbidity ( 3 ⇓ – 5 ). Further, MB-003RAMP provided this level of protection out to 48 h p.i. in the majority of treated animals.
Several factors may explain the incomplete (67%) protection observed by the RAMP-derived mAbs. Although equally effective                               individually in the mouse model, the three mAbs in MB-003 have not been tested individually in macaques. Elimination of an                               ineffective mAb from the mixture and/or higher dosing could improve efficacy. Alternatively, because ADCC is an important                               mechanism of action for these mAbs ( 23 ), polymorphisms of the ADCC-mediating FcγRIIIa receptor ( 28 , 32 ) within the macaque population used in the studies could have affected mAb potency. A polymorphism in approximately half of humans ( 32 ) has been shown to affect ADCC and tumor-cell killing by the FDA-approved mAb, rituximab ( 33 ). Although less well-characterized, three FcγRIIIa polymorphisms have been reported in macaques ( 34 , 35 ), and in one study, 33% (n = 9) of macaques had a FcγRIIIa polymorphism ( 35 ). Finally, there may have been an as-yet-uncharacterized variability within the study population that affected the host response                               to infection.
In this study we used a well-characterized EBOV source (Zaire Kikwit). With improved sequencing tools, the role of EBOV isolate                               sequence differences has recently become topical ( 36 ). For instance, the sequence of EBOV used in this study appears to contain an additional uracil residue in the GP gene-editing                               site. If this is a true mutation (the site causes stuttering of polymerases and may therefore cause sequencing artifacts)                               ( 37 ), this mutation may reduce the amount of sGP processed during an infection ( 36 , 37 ). Although the function of sGP is unknown, sGP has been hypothesized to act as a decoy for protective antibodies. One of                               the three MB-003 mAbs does bind to sGP (13C6), and if this mAb alone is providing the protective efficacy observed in the                               studies described here, the mAb may have reduced efficacy against a strain without this mutation. However, 13C6 is highly                               protective in a mouse model that uses a mouse adapted strain (Zaire Mayinga) that lacks this mutation, which would argue against                               this concern. Regardless, testing of MB-003 against strains other than Zaire Kikwit is planned.
These proof-of-concept studies were designed to reflect postexposure prophylaxis circumstances potentially seen in human cases,                               and show the potential for improvement upon the 1 h p.i. treatment window demonstrated with other EBOV products (siRNA, PMOs,                               and VSV) currently in advanced development. Additional studies will be performed with larger groups to determine if MB-003RAMP has efficacy as a therapeutic (i.e., the treatment window extends to the onset of diagnosis). Future experiments will also                               be aimed at determining which of the mAbs or combination of mAbs used in the mixture offers optimal protection, and identifying                               the best treatment regimen. Stability studies are ongoing, and the RAMP-derived mAbs, like mAbs from mammalian cell culture,                               are expected to have a good stability profile, an important trait for drugs that may be included in the Strategic National                               Stockpile.
Methods
Production of MB-003 mAbs in CHO.
Stable CHO cell lines were generated ( 38 ) expressing h-13F6, c13C6, and c6D8 mAbs and cultured in CD OptiCHO Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented daily with CHO Feed                                     Bioreactor Supplement (Sigma). The CHO culture was grown in suspension using a Wave Bioreactor 20/50 EHT System (GE Healthcare)                                     equipped with a WAVEPOD (GE Healthcare). The glucose level was manually monitored daily and adjusted with sterile 45% glucose                                     solution (Mediatech). Conditioned medium was harvested and clarified via centrifugation, then filtered (0.2 μm) before purification                                     using a 100-mL MabSelect SuRe (GE Healthcare) Protein A column. The column was washed with 1× PBS running buffer and mAb eluted                                     with acetic acid. Eluate was neutralized to pH 7 and diafiltered against the formulation buffer [PBS (pH 7) for h-13F6 and                                     50 mM potassium citrate, 200 mM glycine, 8% (wt/vol) trehalose (pH 5.5) for c13C6 and c6D8] using the Minim Tangential Flow                                     Filtration System (Pall). The mAb solution was then polished with Sartobind Q (Sartorius), sterile-filtered, distributed,                                     and stored at −80 °C until used. All purified mAbs were fully assembled as determined by SDS/PAGE and had less than 8% aggregate                                     as determined by HPLC size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). An Ebola GP antigen-binding ELISA ( 39 ) was used to confirm binding activity in comparison with reference standards prepared from previously manufactured mAbs that                                     had been shown to be efficacious in the mouse EBOV model.
Production of MB-003 mAbs in ΔXTFT N. benthamiana.
For transient expression of the MB-003 mAbs in plants, we used the “magnifection” procedure ( 24 ) with minor modifications as described previously ( 23 ). Briefly, plants grown for 24–26 d in an enclosed growth room at 22–24 °C were used for vacuum infiltration. Equal volumes                                     of overnight-grown Agrobacterium cultures were mixed in infiltration buffer [10 mM Mes (pH 5.5) and 10 mM MgSO4], resulting in a 1:1,000 dilution for each individual culture. Using a 300-L custom-built (Kentucky Bioprocessing) vacuum                                     chamber, the aerial parts of entire plants were inverted into the bacterial/buffer solution and a vacuum of 22 inches of mercury                                     was applied for 2 min. At 7 d postinfiltration, leaf tissue was extracted with a Corenco double-stack disintegrator using                                     a 0.5:1 buffer-to-plant tissue ratio [extraction buffer: 100 mM Tris, 40 mM ascorbic acid, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.5)]. The extract                                     was adjusted to pH 8.0 with 10 M NaOH. Extract was clarified using a plate-frame filter press (ErtelAlsop) with 1.0-μm pads.                                     The antibody was captured from the filtrate using a MabSelect SuRe (GE Healthcare) Protein A column. The column was equilibrated                                     and washed with Tris running buffer and eluted with acetic acid. The resulting eluate was neutralized using 1 M Tris. The                                     mAb solution was then further purified via Q filtration (Mustang Q membrane; Pall). The final polishing column for c13C6 and                                     c6D8 was a CHT, Type I 40-μm (Bio-Rad) column. The column was equilibrated and washed with phosphate running buffer and eluted                                     with running buffer containing NaCl. The final polishing column for h-13F6 was a MEP HyperCel column (Pall), equilibrated                                     and washed with Hepes buffer, washed a second time at a slightly acidic pH to remove product related impurities, and eluted                                     under acidic conditions. The eluate was neutralized to pH 7.0. The final eluates for each antibody were concentrated and diafiltered                                     against their respective formulations [c6D8: 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 200 mM arginine, and 4% (wt/vol) mannitol;                                     h-13F6 and c13C6: 50 mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM glycine, 8% (wt/vol) mannitol, and 0.005% polysorbate 20] using tangential                                     flow ultrafiltration with 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff polyethersulfone membranes. All three antibodies were sterile filtered,                                     aseptically filled into glass vials with serum stoppers, sealed, and stored at −80 °C. mAbs were fully assembled as determined                                     by SDS/PAGE and had less than 5% aggregate as determined by HPLC-SEC. An Ebola GP antigen-binding ELISA was used to confirm                                     binding activity in comparison with reference standards.
N-Glycan Analysis.
N-linked glycans were released by digestion with N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and subsequent derivatization of the free glycan with anthranilic acid (2-AA). The 2-AA–derivatized                                     oligosaccharide was separated from excess reagent by normal-phase HPLC. The column was calibrated with 2-AA–labeled glucose                                     homopolymers and glycan standards. Test sample and 2-AA–labeled glycan standards were detected fluorometrically. Glycoforms                                     were assigned either by comparing their glucose unit (GU) values with those of 2-AA–labeled glycan standards or by comparing                                     with theoretical GU values ( 40 ). Confirmation of glycan structure was performed using liquid chromatography–MS.
Virus Stocks.
EBOV (Zaire Kikwit strain) stocks were developed at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID)                                     using virus originally isolated from an infected patient during the 1995 outbreak and passaged in Vero E6 cells. Stock material                                     used in the first two studies was three passages from the original isolate (the first two of which were performed at the Centers                                     for Disease Control); stock material used in the third study was four passages from the original isolate. This stock has been                                     deemed the national stock for preclinical studies for advanced products. The stock was made by the Department of Defense Critical                                     Reagents Program under the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense. The virus and future viruses                                     generated under this program have been developed under the Filovirus Animal Non-Clinical Group, a multiple-agency group including                                     the Food and Drug Administration to prepare for validated/regulated clinical studies. Statistical comparisons between the                                     stocks used here found no difference in the mean times to death (P = 0.7854) or in the survival curves of all historic controls (P = 0.7873).
NHP Challenge and Care.
Adult male and female rhesus macaques (RHM) were caged individually. RHMs were placed in training jackets (Lomir Biomedical                                  Inc.) for acclimatization at least 4 d before surgery. Surgeries to insert central venous catheters (Groshong 7F; Bard) were                                  performed, and adequate recovery time was given before transfer into BSL4 containment. After catheter placement, custom jackets                                  were used to house and protect the lines (Lomir Biomedical Inc.). These lines were flushed with PBS (BD) and locked with 3                                  mL heparin (BD) at least once every other day to maintain catheter functionality. Animals were attached via a mounted swivel                                  system (Lomir Biomedical Inc.) and acclimatized to containment ∼7 d before challenge. Animals were given monkey chow, primate                                  treats, fruits, and vegetables throughout the course of the study. Animals were observed at least once daily to monitor overall                                  health.
Before challenge, RHMs were anesthetized via i.m. injection of Telazol (0.03 mL/kg) and given a brief physical, at which time                                  baseline weight and temperature were established. Animals were challenged via i.m. route with a target dose of 1,000 pfu/mL                                  diluted from stock virus in DMEM; the actual dose of 690 pfu/mL was confirmed via agarose plaque assay. Animals were placed                                  back into cages and observed until they had regained reasonable mobility.
Verification of Target Dose and Viremia.
Challenge target dose was verified via agarose-based plaque assay. Dilution points were serially diluted 10-fold in EMEM and                                     adsorbed onto Vero E6 cell monolayer in six-well plates. These plates were incubated 1 h at 37 °C/5% CO2 with rocking approximately every 15 min, then immobilized with 2 mL of a 1:1 medium [2× Eagle's Basal Medium with Earle's                                     salts (EBME), 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 1% antibiotics] and 1% agarose (Lonza) mixture. Plates were then incubated for 7 d at 37                                     °C/5% CO2. After incubation, a neutral red stain medium (2× EBME, 10% FBS, neutral red) was blended 1:1 with 1% agarose, and 2 mL was                                     placed into each well. After an additional 24 h of incubation at 37 °C/5% CO2, plates were counted and viremia titers were calculated. Viremia analyses on serum samples and postnecropsy-processed tissues were performed using the same method.
Treatment Preparation.
Treatments were comprised of a three-mAb mixture. Each mAb was equally represented in the treatment mixture. EU/mg values                                     for each mAb were averaged together and were less than 0.5 EU/mg. Treatment for each group was set at 50 mg⋅kg−1⋅mAb−1 of CHO-derived mAb mixture and 16.7 mg⋅kg−1⋅mAb−1 of RAMP N. benthamiana-derived mAb mixture. Treatment for each specific RHM was determined by the animal’s weight before challenge.
RHM Treatments.
The initial treatment for all groups in all studies was a triroute format, involving an i.m. injection at the site of challenge,                                     an i.p. injection, and a continuous i.v. infusion using 60-mL syringes (BD) and syringe pumps (Lomir Biomedical Inc.). The                                     i.m. and i.p. dosing remained consistent in experimental groups, whereas maximum rate of i.v. infusion was calculated based                                     on endotoxin levels of treatment and animal weight. The infusion rates did not exceed safe volume requirements as determined                                     by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)                                     and remained within Food and Drug Administration limits for human use (<5 EU⋅kg−1⋅h−1). Animals were periodically monitored during i.v. treatment and for at least 5 min after placement of a new treatment syringe.                                     After the initial triroute treatment, subsequent treatments were given only by i.v. infusion on predetermined days. RHMs in                                     the two pilot studies were treated on days 0 (1 h p.i.), 4, and 8. The third study included RHMs in 24-h (n = 3) and 48-h p.i. (n = 3) treatment groups, treated on days 1/2, 5/6, 8, and 10, respectively. The irrelevant mAb control (n = 1) was paired with the 24-h group, and the PBS control (n = 1) was paired with the 48-h group in terms of treatment schedule.
Animal Monitoring and Sample Collection.
RHMs were monitored at least once a day for changes in health and diet, as well as notable deviations in behavior. Due to                                  catheterization for the duration of the study, animals were not anesthetized; consequently, weight and temperature data points                                  were not collected. Blood was collected on days 0, 3, 6, 10, 14, 21, and 28 via the external catheter line for complete blood                                  count and chemistry analyses. Blood was also collected on days of euthanasia, time points where animals succumbed to challenge                                  (if possible), and at IACUC-approved time points to determine if optional treatments were required.
Complete blood count analysis was performed using the Coulter Act 10 (Beckman Coulter) on samples collected in EDTA plasma                                  vacuette tubes (Greiner Bio-One). Blood was collected in 2-mL serum vacuette tubes (Greiner Bio-One) and allowed to clot for                                  30 min before use. These samples were spun for 15 min at 500 × g, and the resulting serum was then used in Piccolo 13 discs for chemistry analysis. Additional serum and plasma samples were                                  distributed and frozen at −80 °C for further analysis.
Experiments were conducted under BSL-4 containment conditions; approval for experiments and animal manipulations was given                                  by the USAMRIID IACUC. Animal work was completed by Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care                                  certified staff and under NIH guidelines ( 41 ).
Necropsy and Tissue Processing.
Necropsies were performed on all RHMs. Tissues collected were from liver, kidney, spleen, adrenal, pancreas, and inguinal                                  lymph node.
Tissues were processed using Miltenyi Biotec M tubes and GentleMacs apparatus. All tissues were weighed, and a 10% homogenate                                  (wt/vol) was created in appropriate volumes of EMEM. The homogenates were stored at −80 °C for analysis as needed.
ELISA.
ELISAs were performed using a recombinant EBOV glycoprotein (National Cancer Institute), and plasma samples serially diluted                                     at half-log increments. Goat anti-human IgG (Heavy + Light) (KPL) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)                                     (ABTS) (Millipore) were used as secondary and substrate, respectively. Assays were read at 405 nm absorbance (SpectraMax M5;                                     Molecular Devices). Cutoff values were calculated as 1.5× the average naïve serum reading, plus 3× the SD.
RNA Isolation and RT-PCR.
A 0.25-mL of sample was placed with 0.75 mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen) for tissue homogenates and TRIzol LS (Invitrogen) for serum.                                     RNeasy kits (Qiagen) were used for RNA extraction. One-step quantitative real-time RT-PCR reactions were done on a LightCycler                                     480 (Roche) in 20-μL vol with 5 μL of purified RNA and the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). Primers (forward                                     5′-CGGACCTGGTTTGGTTGTG-3′; reverse 5′-GCTGCAGTGTCGCATCTGA-3′) and TaqMan probe (6-carboxyfluorescein-5′-CCCTTGCCACAATCT-minor                                     groove binder nonfluorescent quencher-3′) (Applied Biosystems) specific for the Ebola Zaire glycoprotein gene were used. Program                                     conditions were reverse transcription at 50 °C for 20 min, and initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min; this was followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s, and annealing, synthesis, and signal acquisition at 60 °C for 20 s; and concluded                                     with final cooling at 40 °C for 30 s. Measurement of viral gene expression was based on a viral RNA standard.

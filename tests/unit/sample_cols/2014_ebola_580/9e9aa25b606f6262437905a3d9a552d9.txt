Original Post:
The ability to rapidly disseminate the findings of primary research as well as informed scientific assessment and opinion is critical in the face of public health emergencies such as the present outbreak of the Ebola virus.  At PLOS, primary research findings can be rapidly and effectively distributed through PLOS Currents: Outbreaks . The unmet need to provide expert commentary and insightful opinion on Ebola as rapidly has led PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases to carefully select expert opinion, social science assessment, or topic reviews for public posting on Speaking of Medicine before formal and rigorous peer review.
The authors of manuscripts identified by the Editors as suitable are offered the opportunity to post their text with the understanding that, because of its quality and likely favorable review, is conditionally accepted for publication in the journal.  Authors are required to provide confirmation of authorship as well as financial disclosure and competing interest statements, which will be posted along with the text.
The Editors of PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases are excited to provide a platform to make available much needed information publicly, openly, responsibly, and as quickly as possible.

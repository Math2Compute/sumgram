The hospital would later report that it resisted immense pressure to let out Sawyer from its hospital against the insistence from some higher-ups and conference organizers that he had a key role to play at the ECOWAS convention in Calabar, the Cross River State capital. In fact, FrontPageAfrica has been informed that officials in Monrovia were in negotiations with ECOWAS to have Sawyer flown back to Liberia.
What the fuck? Someone has an incredibly deadly disease that can be transmitted to others with little difficulty, but "ermergerd we need him, so fuck the possibility of killing millions because money!"
Something tells me that the entire situation and the deaths were due to the 'need' for him to be there, and then him being denied the possibility of attending, so he acted like a manchild and ended up getting people killed. Only good thing to come out of that is he died too, so there's 1 less utterly selfish twat in the world.

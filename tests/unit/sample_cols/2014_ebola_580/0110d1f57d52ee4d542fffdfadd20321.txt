Facts About Ebola in the U.S.
It is important to know that every outbreak of Ebola over the past 40 years has been contained, and we are confident that this one canâand will be contained.Â 
Ebola does not pose a significant risk to the United States.
It is extraordinarily unlikely that Ebola would spread widely in the United States both because the disease requires direct contact with bodily fluid (such as feces, saliva, sweat, urine, vomit, and semen) of someone who is infected with and has symptoms of Ebola (fever greater than 100.4Â°F (38.0Â°C) and additional symptoms, such as severe headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or unexplained bleeding or bruising). And because the United States has a strong health care system and dedicated public health professionals who are prepared to treat any individuals who may have symptoms of Ebola.
To be clear, Ebola is hard to contract:
You canât get Ebola through the air.
You canât get Ebola through the water.
You canât get Ebola through food in the United States.
You can only get Ebola from:
Touching the blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola.
Touching contaminated objects, like needles.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has the most extensive and up-to-date information on Ebola here and abroad. Please visit the CDC website at www.cdc.gov/ebola for more information on Ebola.

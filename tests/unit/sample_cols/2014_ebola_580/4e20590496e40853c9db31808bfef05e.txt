Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan (1975-2014), who gave his life fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone. "And when the moment came, they were minded to resist and suffer rather than to fly and save their lives; they ran away from the word of dishonor, but on the battlefield their feet stood fast, and in an instant, at the height of their fortune, they passed away from the scene, not of their fear, but of their glory." —Pericles, The Funeral Oration  (Photograph by Pardis Sabeti.)

Purpose
NIAID is issuing this Notice to highlight its interest in  research on, and product development for, Zika virus (ZIKV).
Grants
Areas of high priority include, but are not limited to, the  following:
Basic research to understand ZIKV infection,  replication, pathogenesis, and transmission;
Studies to develop animal models to study ZIKV  pathogenesis (especially neurological manifestations and teratogenic potential)  and evaluate candidate therapeutics and vaccines;
Studies on the evolution and emergence of ZIKV  including the identification of factors that affect host-range and virulence;
Virologic and serologic surveillance studies of  the distribution and natural history of ZIKV in mosquitos, non-human primates  and humans, with particular emphasis on hosts(s) reservoirs and cross-species  transmission;
Basic research on the biology of the mosquito  vectors, vector competence studies for replication and transmission of ZIKV,  host-virus interaction and studies on novel vector control methods;
Development of sensitive, specific, and rapid  clinical diagnostic tests for ZIKV;
Development of drugs against ZIKV and broad  spectrum therapeutics against multiple flavivirus strains, including  structure/function studies of ZIKV proteins with the goal of identifying new  therapeutic targets;
Evaluation of the immune response to ZIKV  infection and/or vaccination including cell-mediated and innate immunity;
Evaluation of the immunological interactions  between ZIKV and other flaviviruses (especially dengue and yellow fever virus);  and
Development of effective ZIKV vaccines and  vaccination strategies based on evolving knowledge of host/pathogen interactions  and identification of relevant biomarkers.
Possible funding opportunities that can be used to pursue  these research activities include:

Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)
 
Ebola virus disease is a severe disease that causes haemorrhagic fever in humans and animals. Diseases that cause Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers, such as Ebola, are often fatal as they affect the body's vascular system and can lead to significant internal bleeding and organ failure.
 
The Ebola virus does not spread easily from person to person. It is spread though direct contact with infected bodily fluids, not through casual contact. Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. The current outbreak of Ebola is in West Africa. There have no been any cases of Ebola in Canada and the risk to Ontarians remains low.
 
Algoma Public Health is actively involved in planning for this emerging disease with its healthcare partners, together with Public Health Ontario. We are in contact with hospitals and physicians regarding the latest epidemiology and best practices in response. Preparing for a potential case takes careful planning and coordination and our region is no different than the rest of Ontario in exploring our capacity and increasing knowledge and comfort levels in responding to a suspect case. Support exists across our region and in the province to respond quickly to a potential case of Ebola.

With the extent of the recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa (including >28 000 cases and ≤17 000 survivors), many aspects of Ebola virus have become clearer, including acute manifestations, sequelae, and the possibility of relapse and persistence. 1 Neurologic complications are becoming more commonly recognized in EVD during the acute phase, with long-term sequelae. 2 -  4 More remarkable, however, is the potential for persistence and relapse of EVD in the central nervous system (CNS), as in the case of a nurse who developed meningoencephalitis with seizures, cranial nerve involvement, and radiculitis 9 months after EVD recovery. 5 Ebola virus was recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at higher levels than from the blood, indicating viral replication in the CNS. 5 This case reveals the need to determine the role of the CNS as a potential reservoir for Ebola virus after initial clinical recovery.

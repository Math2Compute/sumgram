EBOV preferentially binds to TCM cells. (A) Activation of isolated CD4+ T cells by EBOV. Expression of HLA-DR versus CD38 (left panel). The EBOV GP+ population (middle panel) was back-gated on HLA-DR+ CD38+ flow cytometry plots (right panel) to determine correlation of GP binding with cell activation. (B) HLA-DR versus CD45RO                                  staining used to determine if activated cells are derived from the naive (CD45RO−) or memory (CD45RO+) subsets. GP+ population (middle panel) was back-gated to HLA-DR+ CD45RO+ plots (right panel). (C) EBOV binding to TEM or TCM determined following staining for CCR7 versus CD45RO. GP binding for each of the 3 quadrants corresponding to TEM, TCM, and naive cells is shown. GP+ cells were back-gated to CCR7+ CD45RO+ plots for TCM quadrant (right panel). (D) Tim-1 expression profile on T-cell subsets. (E) Analysis of Th subsets in primary CD4+ T cells following 1- and 4-day-long stimulation with EBOV. Percentages of naive (CD45RO−), Th2/17 (CD45RO+ CXCR3−), and Th1 (CD45RO+ CXCR3+) cell populations. (F) Analysis of CD4Hi CD38+ T cells after 4-day-long stimulation with EBOV, CD3/CD28 beads, or both EBOV and CD3/CD28 beads. (G) Analysis of HLA-DR+ CD38+ T cells at 4 days following stimulation with EBOV, CD3/CD28 beads, or both EBOV and CD3/CD28 beads. Data in all panels are                                  representative of 1 of 2 independent donors and experiments performed in triplicate wells.
We next examined the effects of short-term (1- and 4-day) cultures of isolated CD4+ T cells in the presence of EBOV (MOI of 0.3 PFU/cell) on the relative percentages of Th2/Th17 cells versus Th1 cells by flow                            cytometry. A decrease in the percentages of the Th1 (CD45RO+ CXCR3+) cells was consistently observed at both time points ( Fig. 6E ). This finding suggests that EBOV may preferentially reduce the Th1 cells or lead to expansion of the Th2/Th17 cells. During                            our analysis, we noted an increase in CD4 expression, which is consistent with cellular activation and division of stimulated                            cells ( 61 ). The majority of CD4Hi cells costained for the activation marker CD38 ( Fig. 6F , bottom left panel). Of note, the addition of EBOV to cells prestimulated with CD3/CD28 activation beads consistently resulted                            in higher levels of activation than that for cells stimulated with CD3/CD28 beads alone ( Fig. 6F , top right versus bottom right). As expected, stimulation with CD3/CD28 beads further upregulated the CD4 receptor on EBOV-exposed                            T cells. Further analysis revealed a greater increase in the percentages of HLA-DR+ CD38+ T cells when cells were costimulated with activation beads and EBOV than when stimulated with beads alone ( Fig. 6G ). Overall, these findings indicate that EBOV preferentially binds and activates a subset within the TCM population and also further stimulates CD4+ T cells following TCR-mediated activation.

DISCUSSION
Our in vivo studies demonstrated the central role of Tim-1 in EVD pathogenesis and indicate a putative therapeutic intervention strategy.                         Previous in vivo studies have demonstrated that simultaneous infusion of an agonistic Tim-1-specific antibody with antigen results in increased                         IL-4- and IFN-γ-expressing CD4+ T cells and prevents the development of respiratory tolerance and increased pulmonary inflammation ( 47 ). We note that while both IL-4 and IFN-γ were significantly elevated in wild-type EBOV-infected mice, a statistically significant                         decrease in both cytokines was detected in serum of EBOV-infected Tim-1−/− mice. Similarly, another study demonstrated that administration of a Tim-1 natural ligand, Tim-4–Ig fusion protein, resulted                         in hyperproliferation of T cells ( 62 ). In the course of EVD, it is likely that EBOV acts as both an antigen (e.g., following infection of APCs and viral peptide                         presentation on major histocompatibility complexes [MHCs]) and a Tim-1 activator through interactions with virion-associated                         PS. In this regard, EBOV fulfills the requirement for both the initial MHC-TCR-dependent activation of T cells and a secondary,                         costimulating signal through virion-associated engagement with Tim-1, which may lead to the hyperactivation observed in recent                         human cases ( 63 ) and contribute to the cytokine storm following EBOV infection.
As evidenced in these studies, however, the combination of our cytokine/chemokine analyses, flow cytometry data, transcriptome                         profile, and the observed rapid internalization of CD3 suggests that EBOV possesses a “superagonist-like” activity, as activation                         is observed in the absence of detectable viral infection/replication in CD4+ T cells or the Jurkat cell line, indicating TCR-independent activation. We note that this is consistent with relative effects                         of anti-Tim-1 antibodies ( 59 ), which showed TCR-independent activation. These findings have demonstrated that Tim-1 signaling can directly activate T                         cells without concomitant TCR-dependent costimulation. Tim-4, a ligand for Tim-1, has been shown to induce CD4+ T-cell expansion and phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) while promoting release                         of both Th1- and Th2-type cytokines, which is consistent with our findings ( 64 , 65 ). In addition, a study by Mariat et al. demonstrated that antibody stimulation of Tim-1 induces CD4+ T-cell proliferation in the absence of MHC class II-dependent signals both in vitro and in vivo ( 66 ). Interestingly, and in support of our findings, the study also indicated that Tim-1 stimulation also induced NFAT signaling                         and cytokine production ( 66 ). Furthermore, de Souza et al. demonstrated that anti-Tim-1 antibodies induce CD69 and CD25 expression on naive murine CD4+ T cells in the absence of TCR stimulus ( 59 ). As shown in our study, siRNA targeting of Tim-1 reduced both CD69 and CD25 ( Fig. 5A and B ). Notably, non-TCR-dependent activation of CD4+ T cells has been previously reported, as anti-CD28 antibodies alone are sufficient to induce mass proliferation of T cells                         ( 67 ). Interestingly, activation with anti-CD28 antibodies primarily induced activation of central memory CD4+ T cells, which, as indicated previously, are the subset to which EBOV preferentially binds in our in vitro binding assays ( Fig. 3C ).
As we noted, EBOV stimulation of CD4+ T cells appears to be dependent on both Tim-1 expression and Lck, as Tim-1–siRNA knockdown and pharmaceutical inhibitors                         reduced EBOV binding and activation. These results are consistent with the previous observations demonstrating that Tim-1                         signaling events are Lck dependent ( 59 ). Within the TCR complex, Tim-1 is directly associated with CD3 ( 65 ); given this physical interaction, it is logical to assume that cross-linking of Tim-1 would have similar effects as TCR                         engagement ( 66 ). The rapid internalization of the CD3 complex, as observed by flow cytometry and trypsin digestion assays, is consistent                         with TCR-complex downregulation following activation. Although previous studies have suggested that EBOV GP may shield MHC                         detection ( 68 , 69 ), we note that these studies were performed in transduced and transfected DCs where GP is highly expressed; as CD4+ T cells are refractory to infection and a relatively low MOI of 1.0 was used for the majority of these studies, it is highly                         improbable that the decrease in CD3 expression is due to shielding effects.
We suggest that EBOV triggers Tim-1 signaling in a manner similar to anti-Tim-1 antibodies; however, it is likely that numerous                         PS–Tim-1 interactions between the long, filamentous EBOV virions and the surface of T cells result in localized cross-linking                         at the plasma membrane, which may further promote activation. Furthermore, the additive effect of culturing T cells in the                         presence of EBOV and CD3/CD28 beads is consistent with findings showing that anti-Tim-1 and CD3/CD28 costimulation results                         in a synergistic increase in activation ( 36 ). We note that although antibody stimulation of Tim-1 alone induces activation of T cells, it is feasible and perhaps likely                         that EBOV binding may induce secondary signals, which cumulatively result in an increased activation.
Tim-1 is upregulated on both activated Th1 and Th2 cells, although its extended expression following activation is normally                         observed in the Th2 cells (1 versus 3 weeks); importantly, several abovementioned studies, which utilized anti-Tim-1 antibodies                         to activate CD4+ T cells, demonstrated a basal level of Tim-1 expression by both primary CD4+ T cells and Jurkat cells ( 47 , 59 , 62 ). As observed in this study, activation of primary CD4+ T cells prior to incubation with EBOV resulted in increased binding ( Fig. 3D ), which is consistent with the increased surface expression of Tim-1 following T-cell activation ( 45 ). Furthermore, we show that the majority of EBOV binding was detected in the central memory subset, which is consistent with                         the elevated Tim-1 expression levels on this specific subset as shown in Fig. 6D and as previously observed in murine memory cells ( 47 ). It is important to note that other cell types expressing Tim-1, including DCs, monocytes, B cells, and epithelial cells                         ( 48 , 70 ), may contribute to the onset of a cytokine storm following PS-dependent activation. Thus, our data indicate a putative role                         of PS-dependent signaling in the development of a cytokine storm through direct interaction with virion-associated PS. Additionally,                         the high levels of circulating apoptotic bodies and released cellular components exposing surface PS may further contribute                         to the onset of a cytokine storm by further stimulating the PS-dependent signaling pathways in CD4+ T cells and other cell types.
The findings presented here demonstrate for the first time that despite the rapid loss and limited cytokine secretion by EBOV-infected                         monocytes and DCs, EBOV directly binds to and activates CD4+ T cells in a TCR-independent manner, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators. We propose that the combination of                         nonspecific activation and increase of inflammatory mediators is among the primary contributing factors in the development                         of a cytokine storm. As our recent study demonstrates that EBOV glycoprotein directly triggers T-cell death ( 23 ), some of the cytokines associated with cell death, such as TNF-α, are likely to contribute to cytokine storm. These findings                         are supported in part by a recent report demonstrating that EBOV-infected patients exhibited relatively high levels of T-lymphocyte                         activation despite experimental therapies ( 63 ). As EBOV-infected DCs and monocytes fail to efficiently activate T cells ( 13 ), we suggest that EBOV directly activates T cells in vivo. Since the extent of the inflammatory response to EBOV is highly correlative with severity of disease and fatal outcomes                         ( 21 , 71 , 72 ), identification of factors contributing to the onset of the cytokine storm phenomenon may enable the development of novel                         therapeutics. In this regard, our data suggest that interfering with EBOV binding and/or activation of Tim-1 signaling appears                         to be a viable therapeutic strategy. This possibility is further supported by previous findings that have shown that inhibiting                         Tim-1 signaling on CD4+ T cells can reduce proliferation and production of inflammatory mediators, which may reduce the deleterious effects associated                         with a cytokine storm ( 32 , 37 , 54 , 55 ).
The complexity of a cytokine storm response, which is characterized by the production of a series of overlapping and often                         redundant pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, has limited the development of therapeutic intervention strategies ( 24 , 37 ). Hence, strategies aimed at dampening the global inflammatory response to EBOV by limiting activation of the cells associated                         with cytokine production may provide a course of treatment. In this regard, tipping the scale in favor of maintaining immune                         homeostasis may be central to promoting recovery. Conversely, premature termination of an inflammatory response or therapeutically                         promoting an anti-inflammatory response following EBOV exposure may further contribute to “immune paralysis” and thereby lead                         to insufficient viremic control in recovering patients ( 24 ). A paradox exists between the induction of an aggressive immune response against EBOV and developing therapeutic strategies                         aimed at stemming the immune response, as survival or mortality requires an intricately balanced pro- and anti-inflammatory                         response.
Overall, our data suggest a putative role of PS sensing in the development of a cytokine storm response during the course                         of infection; however, based on our transcriptome analysis, it is feasible that EBOV directly stimulates additional, non-PS-dependent                         signaling pathways that lead to the production of cytokines following binding to T cells. The role of PS signaling in T lymphocytes                         is not well characterized. However, PS signaling has been shown to enhance TCR-dependent stimulation, leading to more robust                         activation ( 43 ). PS signaling is triggered by its ligands of the Tim family, which are expressed by many cell types ( 73 ). Engagement of T-cell-associated Tim-1 is linked to susceptibility to allergic and asthma responses. Conversely, Tim-3, which is primarily expressed by the Th1 cells, triggers mainly inhibitory signals that result in their apoptosis (reviewed                         in reference 73 ). Thus, virion-associated PS may trigger immune activation or tolerance, depending on the cell type and Tim expression profile.
Our data indicate that the phenotypic changes observed in CD4+ T cells stimulated with EBOV represent a novel, Tim-1-dependent signaling pathway triggered by EBOV that may contribute to                         the onset of a cytokine storm and activation-induced T-cell death ( 74 ), which may further contribute to the observed lymphopenia in EVD. Taken together, our results suggest that EBOV directly                         binds to and activates CD4+ T cells in a Tim-1-dependent manner. Although EBOV is readily internalized following PS-dependent binding, no productive                         viral replication occurs in T cells, suggesting the presence of a cellular restriction factor or the absence of a factor required                         for viral replication. These results also indicate that EBOV possesses “superagonist-like” activity due to increased proliferation                         in comparison to engagement following stimulation with anti-Tim-1 antibodies. It is feasible that EBOV binding to CD4+ T cells triggers additional, non-Tim-1-dependent signaling pathways, which may act as costimulators. Although disabling of                         Tim-1 dramatically increased survival ( Fig. 1 ), disease was still observed, indicating that other pathways important for pathogenesis remain to be identified. Further                         studies are needed to determine the precise role of PS signaling in vivo and its putative role in the onset of a cytokine storm. Overall, these data contribute to understanding of the “immune paralysis”                         during EBOV infections.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
BSL-4 work.All work with EBOV was performed within the Galveston National Laboratory biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories. For removal                            of mouse serum and cell-free supernatants of EBOV-infected cells from BSL-4, they were gamma irradiated using the 5-Mrad dose                            according to the approved University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) standard operating procedure protocol. Either flow cytometry                            was performed in BSL-4 using the Canto-II instrument (BD Biosciences), or cells were treated with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde                            in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 48 h according to the approved UTMB standard operating procedure protocol and removed                            from BSL-4 for analysis with flow cytometers available in the UTMB Flow Cytometry Core Facility. Cell lysates for Western                            blot analysis were prepared by lysis of cells with 4× SDS-Laemmli buffer, followed by incubation at 95°C for 15 min, vortexing,                            and removal from BSL-4 laboratories. Cells for confocal microscopy were placed on slides; stained; fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde                            for 24 h, which was replaced with a fresh solution; incubated for an additional 48 h; and taken out of BSL-4. Staining and                            mounting procedures are described below.
Mouse studies.Infection of mice with mouse-adapted EBOV was approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston Institutional                            Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in the BSL-4 containment facilities of the Galveston National Laboratory. Tim-1−/− mice were kindly provided by Suzanne Cassel, University of Iowa, and described previously ( 75 ). Control C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Eight- to 9-week-old mice were infected by intraperitoneal                            injection with 1,000 PFU of mouse-adapted EBOV, strain Mayinga, which in a previous study was found to be equal to ~30,000                            50% lethal doses ( 45 ). Mice were monitored twice daily from day 0 to day 14 postchallenge, followed by once-daily monitoring from day 15 to the                            end of the study at day 28. Clinical score was assessed as follows: (i) body weight, normal, 0; <10% loss, 1; 10 to 15% loss,                            2; >20% loss, 3; (ii) appearance, normal, 0; lack of grooming, 1; rough coat, possible nasal and or ocular discharge, 2; very                            rough coat, abnormal posture, enlarged pupils, 3; (iii) clinical signs, normal, 0; small change of potential significance,                            1; 25% rise in respiratory/heart rates, 2; 30% rise in respiratory/heart rates or markedly reduced/shallow respiratory/heart                            rates, paralysis, 3; (iv) unprovoked behavior, normal, 0; minor changes, 1; abnormal behavior, less mobile, less alert, inactive                            when activity expected, 2; unsolicited vocalization, extreme self-mutilation, 3; (v) behavior response to external stimuli,                            normal, 0; minor exaggerated response, 1; moderate abnormal response, 2. The overall score was tabulated and used to help                            interpret our assessment of each animal. A total score of 3 or less was considered normal; 4 to 7 indicated some evidence                            of pain or discomfort. Any animal reaching a total score of 8 or a score of 3 in any individual category was euthanized.
Flow cytometry analysis of mouse lymphocytes.Peripheral blood was collected in tubes containing EDTA (Kent Scientific Corp.; catalog identifier MTSC-EDTA) at day 6 postchallenge.                            Erythrocytes were lysed using lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were pelleted at 400                            × g, washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and stained with the following                            antibodies: CD3-brilliant UV 395 (BUV395) (145-2C11; BD Biosciences), CD4-peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)/Cy5.5 (RM4-5;                            BD Biosciences), IFN-γ–phycoerythrin (PE) (XMG1.2; BD Biosciences), TNF-α–fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (MP6-XT22; BD                            Biosciences), and IL-2–allophycocyanin (APC) (JES6-5H4; BD Biosciences).
Multiplex analysis of serum cytokines and chemokine.Serum samples were collected on day 6 post-EBOV infection. Samples were gamma irradiated with the 5-Mrad dose according to                            the UTMB standard operating procedure protocol, removed from the BSL-4 laboratory, and analyzed using a Multiplex-32 magnetic                            bead-based assay (Millipore) by Eve Technologies.
Analysis of viremia.Total RNA was isolated from serum samples taken at day 6 post-EBOV challenge using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit per the manufacturer’s                            protocol (Qiagen). EBOV was quantified with the one-step reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) advanced kit                            for probes (Bio-Rad), with probes specific for the NP gene fragment corresponding to nucleotides 2095 to 2153 of EBOV genomic                            RNA (GenBank accession number AF086833 ) using forward primer GCCACTCACGGACAATGACA, reverse primer GCATGCGAGGGCTGGTT, and probe 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)–AGAAATGAACCCTCCGGCT-MGB.                            Briefly, 50 pg of RNA was added to 5 µl of supermix, 2 µl of reverse transcriptase enzyme, 1 µl of 300 mM dithiothreitol (DTT),                            and 1 µl of 20× NP custom TaqMan assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for each sample. ddPCR mixtures were loaded onto cartridges                            to create droplets on a QX200 droplet generator (Bio-Rad). The droplets were transferred onto 96-well PCR plates (Eppendorf)                            and amplified on a C1000 thermal cycler with a 96-deep-well reaction module (Bio-Rad). The following reaction conditions were                            used: 42°C for 60 min and 95°C for 10 min, followed by 39 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min, and a final enzyme deactivation                            step of 98°C for 10 min. Finally, the PCR plates were loaded onto a droplet reader, which quantifies the number of positive and negative droplets in each sample. Analysis was performed using QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad) to get the final concentrations                            in each sample.
Viruses.Recombinant EBOV, strain Mayinga, expressing GFP ( 76 ), was recovered from transfection of endotoxin-free plasmids harboring viral cDNA as previously described ( 11 ) and propagated by 3 passages in Vero-E6 cell monolayers. Viral stocks were quantified by plaque titration in Vero-E6 monolayers                            as previously described ( 77 ). Mouse-adapted EBOV, strain Mayinga ( 45 ), was obtained from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (Frederick, MD), deposited at the World                            Reference Center of Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (housed at UTMB), and amplified by a single passage in Vero-E6 cells.
Cell lines.Human embryonic kidney 293T (293T) and Vero-E6 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured                            in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and minimal essential medium (MEM), respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated                            fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% HEPES (Corning), 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich), 1%                            sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2% penicillin-streptomycin mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Jurkat human T-lymphocyte                            lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented                            with 10% HI-FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% HEPES (Corning).
Isolation and culture of primary T lymphocytes.Unidentified buffy coats, obtained from the blood of healthy adult donors according to a clinical protocol approved by the                            University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) Institutional Review Board, were provided by the UTMB Blood Bank. Peripheral                            blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated with a Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich) gradient as recommended by the manufacturer.                            Fresh PBMCs were used for isolation of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes by negative selection using magnetic microbead separation kits (Miltenyi Biotec). “No-target” PBMCs were made                            devoid of monocytes and dendritic cells using positive selection for CD14 and CD11c to remove known EBOV target cells. Purity                            typically ranged from 93% to 95% as determined by flow cytometry. T-lymphocyte activation was induced with Dynabeads human                            transactivator CD3/CD28 beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. In some experiments,                            staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a control at a concentration of 1 μg/ml.
Flow cytometry analysis of GP binding.Isolated CD4+ T lymphocytes or Jurkat, 293T, or Vero-E6 cells were plated at the concentration of 1 × 106 cells per well in U-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and placed on ice (to prevent internalization of viruses).                            EBOV was added at the indicated MOIs. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 4°C and washed with PBS containing 2% HI-FBS. Thereafter,                            cells were immunostained with the following antibodies: anti-CD3 labeled with brilliant UV 395 (BUV395) clone UCHT1 (BD Biosciences),                            anti-CD4 labeled with PerCP-Cy5.5 clone 4 Oktober (BioLegend) or anti-CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5 clone RPA-T8 (BioLegend), and rabbit                            antibodies raised against EBOV virus-like particles (VLP) (Integrated BioTherapeutics). For subset binding and depletion assays,                            the following antibodies were used in addition to the CD3 and CD4 antibodies previously described: CD38-Alexa.488 clone HIT2                            (BioLegend), HLA-DR.APC clone L243 (BioLegend), CD45RO-BVLT.786 clone UCH-L1 (BioLegend), CCR7-PE clone G043H7 (BioLegend),                            and CXCR3-Alexa.Fluoro.700 clone 1C6/CXCR3 (BioLegend). After staining, cells were washed three times with PBS containing                            2% HI-FBS, fixed in 10% formalin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), stained with goat anti-rabbit antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor                            647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and washed again 3 times in PBS with 2% HI-FBS. Following surface receptor staining, LIVE/DEAD                            (Thermo Fisher Scientific) staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendation, and cells were fixed with                            10% formalin. Flow cytometry was performed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Fortessa (BD Biosciences) instrument.
Analysis of markers of activation and cytokine analysis.Following CD4+ T-cell isolation, cells were stimulated with EBOV at the indicated MOI for 48 h and surface stained for CD25-Alexa.Fluoro.700                            clone M-A251 (BioLegend) and CD69-PE/Dazzle clone fn50 (BioLegend). Cells were fixed and permeabilized using the True Nuclear                            transcription factor kit (BioLegend) and stained for intracellular Ki-67-BVLT.421 clone B56 (BD Biosciences), IL-2–APC clone                            MQ1-17H12 (BD Biosciences), TNF-α–FITC clone Mab11 (BD Biosciences), and IFN-γ–PE clone B27 (BD Biosciences). Samples were                            then analyzed using a FACS Fortessa instrument (BD Biosciences). Cytokines and chemokines were detected and quantitated from                            supernatants by Eve Technologies (Calgary, Alberta, CA). Heat maps were generated using GENE-E (Broad Institute; http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/index.html ).
Intracellular accumulation of EBOV.Viral binding assays were performed as described under “Flow cytometry analysis of GP binding” above with the additional step                            being performed prior to harvesting cell lysates. Following incubation on ice, cells were either immediately trypsinized or                            shifted to 37°C for 1 h to promote internalization of virions prior to trypsin digestion; nontrypsinized samples were used                            as a control. Cells were pelleted, washed in PBS, lysed as described under “BSL-4 work” above, and analyzed by Western blotting                            with antibodies specific to EBOV NP (IBT Bioservices; catalog no. 301-012), CD3ε (Santa Cruz Biotech; clone M-20), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate                            dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Cell Signaling; clone 14C10). To further confirm reduction in TCR levels, EBOV stimulation was followed                            by Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for CD3ζ (Santa Cruz Biotech; clone 6B10.2).
Analysis of NFAT-1 signaling.CD4+ T cells or Jurkat T lymphocytes were plated at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per well in 96-well plates and mock treated or stimulated for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min with one of the following: 25 ng/ml                            12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 0.5 μM ionomycin, 10 μM cyclosporine (CsA), 1 μg/ml SEB, or EBOV at an MOI of 5. Cells                            were collected, lysed in Laemmli buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and incubated at 95°C for 15 min. Proteins were separated                            by SDS-PAGE using 4 to 12% gradient gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Thermo Fisher                            Scientific) using the I-blot system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS                            for 1 h at 37°C and stained with antibodies specific for mono- (activated) and hyperphosphorylated (nonactivated) NFAT-1 (Novus                            Biologicals, Inc.; catalog no. NB300-504) and GAPDH (Cell Signaling; catalog no. 8884S) diluted according to manufacturer’s                            recommendations in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. Luciferase-based detection of NFAT activity was performed 24 h following electroporation                            of Jurkat cells with pGL3.NFAT-luciferase ( 78 ) (Addgene; catalog no. 17870) using the Neon transfection system per the manufacturer’s recommendation for the Jurkat cell                            line (Invitrogen). EBOV was added at an MOI of 3 while PMA-ionomycin was used as a positive control at 1 µg/ml each. Complete                            medium was added to control wells. Nontransfected Jurkat cells were used for background subtraction. Samples were harvested                            and lysed in 200 µl of passive lysis buffer 6 h following stimulation. Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase                            assay system (Promega; catalog no. E1500). Data were normalized to control wells.
Confocal microscopy.Isolated primary CD4+ T cells were grown in suspension at 1 × 106 cells/well in 12-well plates and loaded on positively charged coverslips (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at 37°C. In some                            experiments, chloroquine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to cell cultures at a concentration of 10 µM prior to the addition of EBOV.                            Cells were stimulated with EBOV at the indicated MOIs at 37°C, placed on ice, washed 3 times with PBS, and fixed with 3.2%                            paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Alfa Aesar) solution in PBS for 15 min. Then,                            cells were washed with PBS, incubated with 0.5 M glycine in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and washed 3 times with PBS.                            Antigen blocking was performed using 5% donkey serum diluted with PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Triton X-100                            (stain buffer) for 1 h. Mouse monoclonal CD3ε, Rab7, and rabbit immune serum against EBOV VLP (Integrated BioTherapeutics)                            were diluted at 1:100 in stain buffer. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, slides were washed 3 times in stain buffer,                            incubated with the mixture of two secondary antibodies (donkey anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 [Thermo Fisher Scientific]                            and donkey anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 [Thermo Fisher Scientific]) diluted at 1:200 in stain buffer for 1 h,                            and washed as described above. Next, cells were incubated with 6-diamine-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Thermo Fisher                            Scientific) at 1 µg/ml for 2 min and washed 3 times in PBS. Slides were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and removed from                            BSL-4 as described above. Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using PermaFluor mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific)                            and analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. Laser beams with 405-nm wavelengths                            were used for DAPI excitation, 488 nm was used for Alexa Fluor 488, and 635 nm was used for Alexa Fluor 647. Emission filters                            were 425/25 nm for DAPI, 515/30 nm for Alexa Fluor 488, and 610/50 nm for Alexa Fluor 647 detection. All images were acquired                            using a 60× oil objective.
Phosphatidylserine-dependent binding assays.Phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster) and used to generate liposomes                            as previously described ( 79 ). CD4+ T cells were preincubated with liposomes at the indicated concentrations for 1 h prior to the addition of EBOV. Annexin V                            (EBioscience) was added to EBOV for 1 h prior to the addition to isolated CD4+ T cells. Flow cytometry analysis of EBOV GP was performed as described above.
Gene knockdown experiments were performed using pooled control or Tim-1-specific siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotech). Jurkat cells                            were electroporated using the Neon transfection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Tim-1 levels were                            assessed by flow cytometry using anti-Tim-1–PE (R&D Systems; clone 219211). Assays were performed 48 h following electroporation                            using previously described culture conditions. The Lck inhibitor, Ly294, and PI3K inhibitor, PP2, were used at final concentrations                            of 10 µM (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates for Western blot analysis were collected 2 h following EBOV or CD3/28 stimulation. Monoclonal                            rabbit antibodies for detecting Akt (clone C67E7), phospho-Akt (D9E), PI3K (19H8), and polyclonal phospho-PI3K were purchased                            from Cell Signaling Technologies.
Transcriptome deep sequencing.Isolated CD4+ T cells from four donors were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence or absence of EBOV at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell. At                            24 and 96 h poststimulation, cells were washed with PBS 3 times, lysed in 1 ml of TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and stored                            at −80°C. Samples were processed for RNA isolation using the Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the                            manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the nanochip format, and only                            intact RNA was used for constructing the mRNA libraries. Libraries were constructed using the Kapa Stranded mRNA-Seq kit (Kapa                            Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were quality controlled and quantitated using the BioAnalyzer                            2100 system and Qubit (Invitrogen). The libraries were clonally amplified and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer                            to achieve a target density of approximately 200,000 to 220,000 clusters/mm2 on the flow cell with dual-index paired-end sequencing at a 75-bp length using NextSeq 500 NCS v1.3 software. Raw reads (75 bp)                            had their adapter sequences removed.
Read processing.General quality control of the raw reads was performed using FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ). rRNA reads were removed via mapping by Bowtie (v2.1.0) using an index of human, mouse, and rat rRNA sequences. On average,                            ~10% of the reads from each sample were identified as mapping to rRNA and were removed from downstream analysis. Reads were                            then mapped against a human reference genome (hg19, build GRCh37, from the UCSC genome browser [ http://genome.ucsc.edu/ ]) using STAR (version 2.4.0h1). Quantitative gene counts were produced from this alignment using HTSeq ( http://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.9.1/ ) utilizing the human annotation associated with the genome.
Differential expression analysis.Gene counts for 25,237 genes for each sample were loaded into the R statistical environment ( http://www.r-project.org ). Genes with no counts were removed, and counts across samples were normalized with edgeR (version 3.10.2) using the weighted                            trimmed mean of M values. Remaining genes without at least three samples with counts were removed, leaving 14,932 genes with                            an average of ~106 reads per sample. Differentially expressed genes were identified using edgeR between treatments and time points and defined                            by using an absolute fold change cutoff of 1.5 and a P value of ≤0.05 after adjustment using the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction. Additional clustering, creation                            of heat maps, and other statistical analyses were performed using R. In the comparison between EBOV-treated samples and mock                            samples at day 1, 2,591 (1,581 upregulated, 1,010 downregulated) differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified. Between                            EBOV-treated and mock samples at day 4, 1,534 (789 upregulated, 745 downregulated) DE genes were identified.
Functional enrichment analysis.Functional analysis of the differential gene expression data was performed with Qiagen’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA;                            Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). Functional annotation of genes for specific biological functions was assigned through querying                            AmiGO (version 2.20). Canonical pathway names were collected by searching for human genes with search queries as described                            in the text.
Network analysis.Functional analysis from IPA provided foundations for generating networks based on differentially expressed genes. DE genes                            with the most interactions with other DE genes were connected together to form networks with molecules from both the experimental                            expression data and IPA Knowledge databases. Each network was scored with a P value indicating its likelihood that these genes in the network could be found by random chance. IPA network scores of 2                            or higher have at least a 99% confidence interval of not being generated by chance alone. The interactions within the network                            are based on IPA’s Knowledge Base and consist of direct and indirect relationships assigned based on primary literature sources.                            A top-scoring network (score of 41) with functions related to inflammation was used as the basis for the network depicting                            the cytokine storm response in Fig. 4F . A network (score of 33) with functions for cell cycle regulation was used in conjunction with its relationship with phosphatidylserine                            to form the phosphatidylserine regulation network in Fig. 5A . A network for cell signaling and interaction (score of 29) was used as a basis for a superantigen response ( Fig. S3 ). Additionally, significant canonical pathways identified from IPA were assigned a Z score, which determines if gene expression changes from the expression data are consistent with the IPA Knowledge Base. Functions                            with a Z score of >2, indicating a strong predicted activation of that function, were chosen to form networks. Genes and interactions                            were additionally added or removed from these networks to highlight genes with the largest changes in expression and for clarity.                            Genes contributing to the construction of the cytokine storm networks were created from stricter absolute log 2-fold change                            cutoffs of >2× to focus on the interactions between the most highly activated genes.
Statistical analyses.Each independent experiment (donor) was performed in triplicate to rule out experimental bias or random error. Data were analyzed                            using statistical methods described in the figure legends using GraphPad Prism 6. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Mean and standard error (SE) of the mean were calculated for all                            graphs.

Ebola virus disease
Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a potentially fatal disease that causes haemorrhagic fever in humans and animals, which can cause significant internal bleeding and organ failure.
Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a rare and severe viral disease. When infected, people can get very sick, with fever, intense weakness, headache, sore throat and pains, and in severe cases, may bleed from different parts of the body (i.e., hemorrhage).
The Ebola virus does not spread easily from person to person. It is spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, not through casual contact. Severely ill patients require supportive care.
The following countries are currently affected by EVD:
Guinea
Liberia
Ontario's health system may encounter patients who have recovered from EVD and who carry the virus. There have been no cases of EVD in Canada and the risk to Ontarians remains very low. For updates on EVD visit Ontario.ca/ebola .
Latest Information
June 2016 - The World Health Organization (WHO) declares the end of Ebola virus transmission in the Republic of Guinea and in Liberia. Forty-two days have passed since the last person confirmed to have Ebola virus disease tested negative for the second time. Guinea and Liberia now enter a 90-day period of heightened surveillance to ensure that any new cases are identified quickly before they can spread to other people.

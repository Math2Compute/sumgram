The Ebola virus has had a devastating effect in West Africa. Thousands of people have died from the disease and thousands more have been infected. 
The highly contagious nature of the virus makes it even more difficult to contain, as it can even put the lives of the health workers treating patients at risk. These photos celebrate the extraordinary local health workers who are responding to the outbreak in International Medical Corps’ new Ebola Treatment Unit in Bong County, Liberia. Without the bravery of these doctors and nurses, many of them from the local community, people affected by the illness would have nowhere to go to get help.

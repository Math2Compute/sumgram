However, because the Ebola outbreak in Liberia is now over, CDC no longer recommends active monitoring for those travelers arriving in the United States from Liberia.
Upon entry, travelers will still have their temperatures taken and be asked questions about travel history and possible exposures to Ebola. Travelers will also need to provide their contact information so that the health department at their destination can connect with them, if needed.
Travelers from Liberia will now receive a modified CARE Kit including information about Ebola, a thermometer, and contact information for state and local health departments. Travelers from Liberia will be encouraged to watch their health for 21 days after leaving Liberia, and to contact their state or local health department if they develop fever or any other symptoms that might be consistent with Ebola.
Travelers will still undergo exit screening before departing from Liberia. Entry screening and monitoring will not change for travelers entering the United States from Guinea or Sierra Leone – this includes travelers from Liberia who have also traveled to either Guinea or Sierra Leone within the past 21 days.

Outbreak Update
As of July 14, 2015, Liberia has reported six confirmed cases of Ebola. The initial case was in a 17-year-old male who died on June 28, 2015. All of the cases appear to be from the same cluster in Margibi County. A CDC field team continues to work with the Liberian Ministry of Health and other partners to determine the source, understand the chain of transmission, and prevent further spread. Genetic sequencing indicates that the virus is similar to strains circulating in Liberia last year. This finding rules out the likelihood that the infection was imported from Sierra Leone or Guinea. The initial case was confirmed June 29, as a result of the enhanced surveillance and response system, which includes testing and safely burying bodies, put into place after Liberia was declared free of Ebola transmission in May.
According to WHO’s July 8 Situation Report , there were 30 confirmed cases of Ebola reported in the week up to July 5. Although this is the highest weekly total since mid-May, improvements to case investigation and contact tracing, together with enhanced incentives to encourage case reporting and compliance with quarantine measures, have led to a better understanding of chains of transmission than a month ago. This has resulted in a decreasing proportion of cases from unknown sources of infection.

Outbreak Update
On June 29, routine surveillance detected a new confirmed case of Ebola in Liberia  —the first since March 20. The case is in a 17-year-old male who presented at a local health facility and was treated for malaria. He died on June 28 and post mortem testing confirmed Ebola. Close to 200 people had contact with the man and are now being closely monitored. Two of those people developed symptoms of Ebola and have tested positive for Ebola. Both patients are being treated at an Ebola treatment center that had been kept ready as part of Liberia’s 90-day heightened vigilance period following the declaration of the end of the outbreak on May 9.

May 27, 2015
Outbreak Update
On May 25, CDC and the New Jersey Department of Health confirmed a death from Lassa fever in a person returning to the United States from Liberia. Tests for Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers were negative. CDC is working with public health officials to identify people who had contact with the patient. Those identified as close contacts of the patient will be monitored for 21 days to see if symptoms occur.
According to WHO’s May 27 SitRep , a total of 9 confirmed cases were reported in Guinea in the week leading up to May 24, compared with 27 cases the previous week. In Sierra Leone, a total of 3 confirmed cases were reported in the week leading up to May 24, compared with 8 the week before. The west-Guinean prefecture of Forecariah reported the most cases of any one district, and continues to present the greatest challenge in terms of response, with multiple chains of transmission over a wide geographical area and the continued occurrence of cases from unknown sources of infection.
The last health worker infection in Guinea was reported on April 6 and May 14 in Sierra Leone. There have been a total of 869 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 507 reported deaths.

May 20, 2015
Outbreak Update
According to the WHO’s May 20 SitRep , a total of 35 new confirmed Ebola cases were reported from Guinea and Sierra Leone in the week leading up to May 17. This is a substantial increase compared with the nine total cases reported the previous week.  The geographical area of transmission has also expanded compared with recent weeks, with a total of six districts reporting cases (three in Guinea and three in Sierra Leone). In Sierra Leone, only one of the eight confirmed cases has an unknown source of infection. In Guinea, nine of the 27 reported cases originated from an unknown source, indicating that chains of transmission continue to evade detection in several areas.
On May 12, a laboratory-confirmed case of Ebola was reported in a volunteer health worker who returned to Italy from Sierra Leone on May 7.
May 13, 2015
Outbreak Update
According to the WHO’s May 13 SitRep , a total of 9 new confirmed Ebola cases were reported in the week leading up to May 10: seven cases in Guinea and two cases in Sierra Leone. This is the lowest weekly total this year.  In the previous week, both countries reported nine cases. As of May 12, Sierra Leone had reported eight consecutive days without a confirmed case. Of the seven cases reported for Guinea, six came from one prefecture,  which has been the focus of transmission for several weeks.  Four of the six cases were from one sub-prefecture that borders Sierra Leone. The seventh confirmed case was identified post mortem in a separate prefecture. Investigations have not been able to establish a link with a previously reported case. The absence of an established epidemiological link between this case and a known chain of transmission is of concern. Preliminary reports from that prefecture since May 10 indicate that the case has resulted in at least three additional confirmed cases.
In total, four of the seven cases reported from Guinea in the week leading up to May 10 were identified post mortem. One of the seven cases was a registered contact of a previous case. For the third consecutive week there was a decline in the number of reported unsafe burials, with 23 unsafe burials out of 368 reported community deaths. Based on the information above, tracking transmission chains is still a challenge and there remains a possibility of an increase in case reports and/or geographical spread in the coming weeks.
In Sierra Leone, the two reported cases were from one area of Freetown. The two patients were known contacts of a previous case and were under quarantine when symptoms developed. Following treatment, one of the two patients has tested negative for Ebola two times. 
On May 9, the Ebola virus outbreak in Liberia was declared over after 42 days had elapsed since the burial of the last confirmed case in the country. The country has now entered a three-month period of heightened vigilance. WHO will maintain an enhanced presence in the country until the end of 2015, with a particular focus on areas that border Guinea and Sierra Leone.
On May 12, WHO received notification of a laboratory-confirmed case in Italy. The patient is a volunteer health worker who returned from Sierra Leone on May 7. The patient developed symptoms on May 10 and was transported to a hospital infectious diseases ward on May 11. The patient was transferred to the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome on May 12, following confirmation of Ebola. There have been a total of 868 confirmed healthcare worker infections reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 507 reported deaths.
May 6, 2015
Outbreak Update
Ebola virus has been found in the semen of some men who have recovered from Ebola infection. It is possible that Ebola could be transmitted through sex. Until more information is known, avoid contact with semen from a male survivor. If male survivors have sex (oral, vaginal, or anal sex), a condom should be used correctly and consistently every time. The risk of getting Ebola from semen is considered to be very low and likely decreases over time. CDC and other public health partners are continuing to study Ebola transmission and will share what is known as it becomes available.
According to the WHO’s May 6 SitRep , a total of 18 new confirmed Ebola cases were reported in Guinea and Sierra Leone in the week leading up to May 3, compared to 33 the previous week. This is the lowest weekly total this year. In the last month, between 30 and 37 confirmed cases have been reported each week.
The nine cases reported for Guinea came from one prefecture, while the nine cases reported for Sierra Leone came from two districts. This is the lowest number of total districts to report a confirmed case in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since May 2014.
In Guinea, the nine reported cases were widely dispersed throughout six separate sub-prefectures. Five of the nine cases were identified post mortem. Four of the nine cases were a registered contact of a previous case, including one of the cases identified post mortem. There were 36 unsafe burials reported from seven prefectures in the week leading up to May 3. Of 374 laboratory samples tested in the week leading up to May 3, 4% tested positive for Ebola. Based on the information above, tracking transmission chains is still a challenge and there remains a possibility of an increase in case reports and/or geographical spread in the coming weeks.
In Sierra Leone, five of the nine reported cases were from a district that borders the prefecture in Guinea that reported cases. Three of the nine cases were identified post mortem, and two of the nine cases were a registered contact of a previous case. After further investigation, an additional five of the nine cases were found to be linked to a known chain of transmission. Of 1654 samples tested in the week leading up to May 3, less than 1% tested positive for Ebola.
The last confirmed patient with Ebola in Liberia passed away on March 27. Heightened vigilance is being maintained throughout the country, with 319 new laboratory samples tested for Ebola in the week leading up to May 3. On May 9, 42 days will have elapsed since the burial of the last confirmed case in the country.
For the third consecutive week, no new healthcare worker infections were reported in the week leading up to May 3. There have been a total of 868 confirmed healthcare worker infections reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 507 reported deaths.

According to the WHO’s April 29 SitRep , a total of 33 new confirmed Ebola cases were reported in Guinea and Sierra Leone in the week leading up to April 26, compared to 31 the previous week. Five prefectures in Guinea and three districts in Sierra Leone reported a new confirmed case. Liberia reported no new confirmed cases in the week leading up to April 26. Thirty-nine of the 55 districts in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone that reported at least one confirmed case of Ebola since the start of the outbreak have not reported a case in over six weeks.
In Guinea and Sierra Leone, cases continue to be identified after post-mortem testing and about half of all new cases arise in people not identified as contacts of previous cases, suggesting that surveillance and community engagement still require improvement in some areas. A case-finding and community-awareness campaign took place in one Guinean prefecture from April 24-27, with over 57,000 households visited. During the operation, there was a 91% increase in the number of alerts reported. None of the alerts resulted in confirmed cases; however, ten laboratory samples are still pending. Similar operations are planned for four other prefectures.
The last confirmed patient with Ebola in Liberia passed away on March 27. Heightened vigilance is being maintained throughout the country, with 194 new laboratory samples tested for Ebola in the four days leading up to April 23.

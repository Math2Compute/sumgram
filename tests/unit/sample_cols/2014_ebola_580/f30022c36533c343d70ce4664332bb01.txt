Ebola Virus Antibodies
Ebola Virus Antibodies
Ebola virus is an enveloped, negative-stranded RNA virus. This virus belongs to the family Filoviridae and has a distinctive morphology similar only to that of Marburg virus, but apparently has no antigenic characteristics of Marburg virus. Its genome is a nonsegmented RNA strand. SDS-PAGE profiles demonstrate the presence of seven structural proteins. These are the major nucleoprotein NP (104 K), glycoprotein GP (125K), L protein (180 K), and four proteins: VP40 (40 K), ëVíPX (35 K), VP30 (30 K) and VP24 (24 K). All the proteins are encoded by monocistronic mRNA transcripts complementary to virion RNA. GP is the major protein of the surface spikes and only this 125K viral protein is glycosylated.

Since humans are the principal host for Guinea worm, and there is no evidence that D. medinensis has ever been reintroduced to humans in any formerly endemic country as the result of non-human infections, the disease can be controlled by identifying all cases and modifying human behavior to prevent it from recurring. [8] [37] Once all human cases are eliminated, the disease cycle will be broken, resulting in its eradication. [8]
The eradication of Guinea worm disease has faced several challenges:
Inadequate security in some endemic countries
Lack of political will from the leaders of some of the countries in which the disease is endemic
The need for change in behavior in the absence of a magic bullet treatment like a vaccine or medication
Inadequate funding at certain times [10]
1980s[ edit ]
In 1984, the WHO asked the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to spearhead the effort to eradicate dracunculiasis, an effort that was further supported by the Carter Center , former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's not-for-profit organization. [34] In 1986, Carter and the Carter Center began leading the global campaign, in conjunction with CDC, UNICEF , and WHO . [38] At that time the disease was endemic in Pakistan, Yemen and 17 countries in Africa, which reported a total of 3.5 million cases per year.
Carter made a personal visit to a Guinea-worm endemic village in 1988. He said, "Encountering those victims first-hand, particularly the teenagers and small children, propelled me and Rosalynn [his wife] to step up the Carter Center's efforts to eradicate Guinea worm disease." [39]
1990s[ edit ]
In 1991, the World Health Assembly (WHA) agreed that Guinea worm disease should be eradicated. [25] At this time there were 400,000 cases reported each year. The Carter Center has continued to lead the eradication efforts, primarily through its Guinea Worm Eradication Program. [40]
In the 1980s, Carter persuaded President Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan to accept the proposal of the eradication program, and by 1993, Pakistan was free of the disease. Key to the effort was, according to Carter, the work of "village volunteers" who educated people about the need to filter drinking water. [34]
2000s[ edit ]
Other countries followed the example of Pakistan, and by 2004, Guinea worm was eradicated in Asia.
In December 2008, The Carter Center announced new financial support totaling $55 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Kingdom Department for International Development . [41] The funds will help address the higher cost of identifying and reporting the last cases of Guinea worm disease. Since the worm has a one-year incubation period, there is a very high cost of maintaining a broad and sensitive monitoring system and providing a rapid response when necessary. [41]
One of the most significant challenges facing Guinea worm eradication has been the civil war in Southern Sudan , which was largely inaccessible to health workers due to violence. [10] [42] To address some of the humanitarian needs in Southern Sudan, in 1995, the longest ceasefire in the history of the war, and the longest humanitarian cease-fire in history, [43] was achieved through negotiations by Jimmy Carter. [10] [42] Commonly called the "Guinea worm cease-fire," both warring parties agreed to halt hostilities for nearly six months to allow public health officials to begin Guinea worm eradication programming, among other interventions. [42] [44]
Public health officials cite the formal end of the war in 2005 as a turning point in Guinea worm eradication because it has allowed health care workers greater access to Southern Sudan's endemic areas. [45] In 2006, there was an increase from 5,569 cases in 2005 to 15,539 cases, as a result of better reporting from areas that were no longer war-torn. The Southern Sudan Guinea Worm Eradication Program (SSGWEP) has deployed over 28,000 village volunteers, supervisors and other health staff to work on the program full-time. The SSGWEP was able to slash the number of cases reported in 2006 by 63% to 5,815 cases in 2007. Since 2011, at the time that South Sudan became an independent nation-state, its northern neighbour Sudan had reported no endemic cases of dracunculiasis . [46]
Sporadic insecurity or widespread civil conflict could at any time ignite, thwarting eradication efforts. [46] The remaining endemic communities in South Sudan are remote, poor and devoid of infrastructure, presenting significant hurdles for effective delivery of interventions against disease. Moreover, residents in these communities are nomadic, moving seasonally with cattle in pursuit of water and pasture, making it very difficult to know where and when transmission occurred. The peak transmission season coincides with the rainy season, hampering travel by public health workers. [47]
Another remaining area in Africa remained challenging to ending Guinea worm: northern Mali , where Tuareg rebels made some affected areas unsafe for health workers. Four of Mali's regions—( Kayes , Koulikoro , Ségou , and Sikasso )—have eliminated dracunculiasis, while the disease is still endemic in the country's other four regions ( Gao , Kidal , Mopti , and Timbuktu ). Late detection of two outbreaks, due to inadequate surveillance resulted in a meager 36% containment rate in Mali in 2007. [46] The years 2008 and 2009 were more successful, however, with containment rates of 85% and 73% respectively. [48] The civil war prevented accurate information from being gathered in northern Mali in 2012.
In Ghana, after a decade of frustration and stagnation, in 2006 a decisive turnaround was achieved. Multiple changes can be attributed to the improved containment and lower incidence of dracunculiasis: better supervision and accountability, active oversight of infected people daily by paid staff, and an intensified public awareness campaign. After Jimmy Carter's visit to Ghana in August 2006, the government of Ghana declared Guinea worm disease to be a public health emergency. The overall rate of contained cases has increased in Ghana from 60% in 2005, to 75% in 2006, 84% in 2007, 85% in 2008, 93% in 2009, and 100% in 2010. [46] [48] [49]
From June 2006 to March 2008, there had been no cases reported in Ethiopia. [50] No indigenous cases were reported in Chad in the 2010s. [49]
2010s[ edit ]
On 30 January 2012 the WHO meeting at the Royal College of Physicians in London launched the most ambitious and largest coalition health project ever, known as London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases which aims to end/control dracunculiasis by 2020, among other neglected tropical disease . [51] This project is supported of all major pharmaceutical companies, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the governments of the United States , United Kingdom DFID and United Arab Emirates and the World Bank . [52]
2015[ edit ]
In 2015, 22 cases of dracunculiasis were reported: nine in Chad, three in Ethiopia, five in Mali and five in South Sudan. This is an 83% reduction from 2014. The proportion of people contained (i.e. treated and isolated from drinking water sources early enough to remove the risk they can contaminate the water source) is 36%, compared to 73% in 2014. That means 14 cases have not been contained in 2015, compared to 34 cases in 2014. Nine of these 14 cases not contained were in Chad. [53]
A significant change from 2014 is the increased effort being used to identify and treat infected dogs — mainly in Chad where the vast majority of cases of dogs hosting the worm have been found, but also significantly in Ethiopia. In 2015, 483 infected dogs were identified and treated in Chad — more than 20 times the number reported in humans worldwide. This is more than four times larger than the number treated in 2014 (114 dogs). A major factor in this increase is probably the financial reward started in January for reporting an infected dog. 68% of dogs treated were also contained, compared to 40% in 2014. Dogs are believed to be the major source of the parasite infecting humans in Chad, a country in which no indigenous cases of guinea worm had been reported in the decade leading up to 2010. [49] 15 dogs outside Chad have also been identified and treated, as well five cats and one baboon. The August Carter Center report predicts that Chad may be the last country that eliminates dracunculiasis, and reports on further ongoing research into the relationship between the parasite and dogs there, and some different treatments for dogs. It also predicts that the large increase in monitoring, treating and containing dogs this year will not affect the number of human cases for many months due to the one-year incubation period of the disease. [35] [53] [54]
In August 2015, when discussing his diagnosis of melanoma metastasized to his brain, Jimmy Carter stated that he hopes the last Guinea worm dies before he does. [55]
2016[ edit ]
In 2016, 25 cases have been reported - 16 in Chad, six in South Sudan and three in Ethiopia. No cases were reported in Mali. [56] This was the first increase in yearly case count. Instability around Juba in South Sudan has caused the evacuation of all expatriate SSGWEP staff. Members of the local staff have been given the option of continuing to work if possible. It is unclear what impact this is having. The efforts against infected dogs continue to increase in Chad, with 498 dogs being identified and treated up to 31 May, compared to 196 cases in the same period the previous year. The level of containment of infected dogs before they become a risk of spreading the parasite has improved to 81% compared to 67% last year. [57]
In 2016 Chad reported provisional totals of 1,011 infected domestic dogs (66% contained), 11 infected domestic cats (55% contained) and 16 human cases (56% contained). In the same year Mali reported 11 infected dogs (8/11 contained). Ethiopia reported 14 infected dogs (71% contained), two infected baboons and three infected humans (67% contained). [56] An infected wild frog was reported in Chad. [58]
2017[ edit ]
Up to the end of October 2017, 26 human cases had been reported — 14 in Chad and 12 in Ethiopia: 10 were contained. [56] Between January and October, Chad reported 750 infected dogs and 12 infected domestic cats. Ethiopia reported 25 infected dogs and 6 infected baboons. Mali reported 8 infected dogs and 1 infected cat.

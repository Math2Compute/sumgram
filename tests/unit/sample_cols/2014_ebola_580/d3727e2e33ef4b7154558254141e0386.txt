You're right in not assuming the non-integration means non-inhibition, but in this case it's a good indicative. In a lot of cases, you can attribute to proofreading the reduced integration. However, it's never the lack of it. Proofreading is not perfect and you end up with a few analogues incorporated into the DNA/RNA if proofreading was the limiting factor.
In this case it seems like they see nothing. This tells me that the catalysis of the polymerization reaction isn't happening. It could still be binding to the RNA-pol, but then you should see clear signs of toxicity then because it would be inhibiting the normal enzyme function.
I think they need to do a ligand-affinity chromatography experiment, maybe a gel mobility shift assay or something to assess the affinity of human RNA-pol to the analogue compared to the viral RNA-pol.
PS: The generally-accepted abbreviation is RNA pol, but I tend to write it as RNA-poly. I don't know why.

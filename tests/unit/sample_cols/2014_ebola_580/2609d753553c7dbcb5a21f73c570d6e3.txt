A group of Army "soldier-scientists" is deploying to Liberia to establish four laboratories to aid U.S. efforts to address the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Defense Department said in a news report. The deployment may last up to a year.
They are members of the Army's 1st Area Medical Laboratory—an expeditionary lab unit of the Army's 20th CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and high-yield Explosives) Command, which is based at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
The 22-member team—which includes microbiologists, biochemists and lab technicians—will conduct Ebola surveillance and test patient samples at the labs it will set up outside the Liberian capital, Monrovia, DOD said . The team will bring its own equipment.
While testing currently takes place at labs in Monrovia, the distribution of the Army labs outside the city will make it easier for samples in outlying areas to reach a lab without the need to send them long distances over poor roads into the capital.
Described as an "organic unit" that continuously lives and trains together specifically to perform this kind of work, the lab team receives ongoing technical training through a relationship with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md.
The unit is slated to arrive in Monrovia at the beginning of November.

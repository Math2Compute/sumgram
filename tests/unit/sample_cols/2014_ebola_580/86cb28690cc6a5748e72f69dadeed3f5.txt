Overview
WHO issued this roadmap for scaled-up response to the Ebola outbreak. The goal is to stop Ebola transmission in affected countries within 6-9 months and prevent international spread.
The roadmap will assist governments and partners in the revision and resourcing of country-specific operational plans for Ebola response, and the coordination of international support for their full implementation. The objectives are:
to achieve full geographic coverage with complementary Ebola response activities in countries with widespread and intense transmission
to ensure emergency and immediate application of comprehensive Ebola response interventions in countries with an initial case(s) or with localized transmission
to strengthen preparedness of all countries to rapidly detect and respond to an Ebola exposure, especially those sharing land borders with an intense transmission area and those with international transportation hubs.

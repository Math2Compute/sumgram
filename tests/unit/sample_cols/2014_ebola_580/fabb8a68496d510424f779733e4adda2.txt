In Sierra Leone, one of the easiest and cheapest ways of getting from place to place is by hopping on the back of one of the Okada motorcycle taxis, now those drivers are learning safer practices.
Now that Ebola has been nearly defeated in West Africa, re-establishing basic social services in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are of primary importance. Building resilience â strengthening health care, education and sanitation systems and humanitarian assistance â will help these nations cope in the aftermath of the Ebola epidemic.
The outbreak was unprecedented in scope and intensity, and hit some of the most vulnerable communities in some of the worldâs poorest countries. Millions of children were affected in some way or other â falling victim to the deadly virus, becoming orphans, facing stigmatization, losing months of school education, and being traumatized. Now is the time to rebuild.
International solidarity remains essential in the ongoing aftermath of this devastating virus and its effects. Helping the affected countries build back better will mean theyâll be more equipped to prevent another such outbreak and to tackle other killer diseases â such as malaria, measles, pneumonia and diarrhoea â that take a heavy toll on children.

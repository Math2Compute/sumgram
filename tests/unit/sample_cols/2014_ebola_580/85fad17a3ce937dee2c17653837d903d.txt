Daily Mail-o-matic
It’s that simple – this gives you a new Daily Mail headline every time you click the button. Guaranteed not to give you cancer or affect your house prices.
 
I was going to give the generator a sophisticated grammar for more varied sentences, until I realised the Mail‘s grammar is nearly always the same. If you like this, be sure to check out my blog and follow me on Twitter too!

Is the online presence of Chris Applegate, geek and wannabe polymath.
This is my personal blog, where I blog about anything I like, but more often than not it's to do with digital culture, society, politics and the interaction between all three. All views here are, of course, mine personally and not necessarily those of my employers or associates.
As well as what I blog here, you might be interested in what I have to say on Twitter or my linklog on Delicious .

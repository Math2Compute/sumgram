Ebola Virus Disease
The first case of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) diagnosed in the United States was confirmed on September 30, 2014 in Dallas, Texas. The risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States remains low. Orange County Health Care Agency is working with community partners, including healthcare facilities, to assure that our community is prepared to safely care for and respond to a suspect case. Health care providers should remember to obtain a travel history for any patients with febrile illness, and be familiar with Ebola's clinical presentation and infection control requirements. See Provider Notice for more information.Â 
Person Under Investigation (PUI)
A person who has both consistent signs or symptoms and risk factors as follows:
Elevated body temperature or subjective fever or symptoms, including severe headache, fatigue, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or unexplained hemorrhage; AND
Travel to or residence in a country with widespread Ebola transmission or contact with a person with Ebola within the 21 days before the onset of symptoms.
How does Ebola spread?
Ebola spreads from person-to-person by direct contact with a patientâs body fluids, like saliva, blood, vomit, urine, feces, and sweat. The virus gets into the body through broken skin or mucous membranes (spongy skin like the kind you find in your nose or mouth). Ebola can also be spread by infected objects, like needles, that have been tainted with body fluids. Ebola can also spread after death, when preparing the patientâs body for burial. Ebola canât spread through the air, in food, or water. It takes 8â10 days for most people to get symptoms, but it can range from 2â21 days. Patients can spread the virus while they have a fever or other symptoms. People who donât have symptoms canât spread Ebola.

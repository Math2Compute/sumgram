Ebola Virus
Ebola Virus Information
Although the risk of Ebola remains extremely low in the U.S., we must be prepared to identify and respond to suspect cases, and as long as the epidemic grows in West Africa, it is highly likely that the U.S. and other countries will experience some new cases.
Our goal is to keep our community safe; to assure that our public health and healthcare systems are able to safely and effectively identify and manage a suspect or confirmed Ebola case and possible contacts; and to appropriately communicate with the public.

Predicting Ebola Severity: A Clinical Prioritization Score for Ebola Virus Disease
Mary-Anne Hartley, 
Abstract
Background
Despite the notoriety of Ebola virus disease (EVD) as one of the world’s most deadly infections, EVD has a wide range of outcomes, where asymptomatic infection may be almost as common as fatality. With increasingly sensitive EVD diagnosis, there is a need for more accurate prognostic tools that objectively stratify clinical severity to better allocate limited resources and identify those most in need of intensive treatment.
Methods/Principal Findings
This retrospective cohort study analyses the clinical characteristics of 158 EVD(+) patients at the GOAL-Mathaska Ebola Treatment Centre, Sierra Leone. The prognostic potential of each characteristic was assessed and incorporated into a statistically weighted disease score. The mortality rate among EVD(+) patients was 60.8% and highest in those aged <5 or >25 years (p<0.05). Death was significantly associated with malaria co-infection (OR = 2.5, p = 0.01). However, this observation was abrogated after adjustment to Ebola viral load (p = 0.1), potentially indicating a pathologic synergy between the infections. Similarly, referral-time interacted with viral load, and adjustment revealed referral-time as a significant determinant of mortality, thus quantifying the benefits of early reporting as a 12% mortality risk reduction per day (p = 0.012). Disorientation was the strongest unadjusted predictor of death (OR = 13.1, p = 0.014) followed by hiccups, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, dyspnoea and myalgia. Including these characteristics in multivariate prognostic scores, we obtained a 91% and 97% ability to discriminate death at or after triage respectively (area under ROC curve).
Conclusions/Significance
This study proposes highly predictive and easy-to-use prognostic tools, which stratify the risk of EVD mortality at or after EVD triage.
Author Summary
The unprecedented spread of EVD across the fragile healthcare systems of West Africa during the 2013–2015 outbreak infected over 28,600 patients and established it as a disease for which low-income countries are at disproportionate risk. In order to improve the standard of patient care, it is essential to better allocate scarce resources amongst the heterogeneous symptomatic presentations of EVD. This retrospective cohort study on 158 EVD(+) patients in Sierra Leone constructs 2 easy-to-use scoring systems that accurately stratify EVD severity and thus objectively identify the patients in most need of intensive therapy. Using statistically weighted symptoms and demographic characteristics, we obtained scores with a 91% and 97% ability to discriminate death at or after triage respectively. These scores included Ebola viral load, patient age and referral time as well as the symptoms of disorientation, haemorrhage and myalgia. Further univariate analysis revealed several independent predictors of mortality, where patients aged between 5 and 25 years were most likely to survive, while malaria co-infection increased the risk of death by 2.5-fold (p = 0.01). Correcting referral-time for viral load, we also quantify the benefits of early reporting as a 12% mortality risk reduction per day (p = 0.012). Mortality in this cohort was 3-fold more than patients treated in resource-rich settings (60.8% vs. 18%) and we propose that focused patient care is a feasible and low-cost effort that may begin to close this gap.

Introduction
Ebola virus disease (EVD) caused by the virulent Zaire ebolavirus strain is described by the WHO as one of the world’s most deadly infections, with case fatality rates exceeding 80% in past epidemics [ 1 , 2 ]. Supportive care in the 2013–2015 outbreak in West Africa was shown to reduce the EVD mortality rate to around 50% [ 3 ], and overall, the WHO has reported 40% fatalities among the 28,603 people affected by EVD [ 4 ]. Despite its notoriety as a fatal disease, over 80% of patients survived when treated in resource-rich environments of Europe and the USA [ 5 ]. Further, asymptomatic infections are not only possible but could constitute up to a third of all transmissions [ 6 – 9 ]. Overlooking these infected (but minimally contagious) individuals was proposed to result in the overestimation of EVD epidemic modelling, and revealed the heterogeneous range of EVD symptomology [ 10 ]. Improved prognostic tools that objectively stratify mortality risk among EVD patients could better allocate limited resources by identifying those most in need of intensive treatment and to aid clinical decision-making. Further, the clinical trials undertaken in the Ebola response have been criticised for the potential bias introduced via the lack of randomisation and contemporaneous controls [ 11 , 12 ]; thus, a method of objectively controlling differences in mortality risk among participants may aid analysis.
Existing EVD staging models used in Sierra Leone, were based on a WHO protocol adapted from the clinical presentation of Lassa fever [ 13 ], where 3 symptomatic stages were described: 1) Early/non-specific, 2) gastrointestinal and 3) late/complicated, featuring haemorrhage and organ failure. While it has since been shown that these three stages of the disease are broadly correlated to EVD outcome [ 14 ], the system could be greatly improved by using statistically weighted symptoms that better stratify the risk of mortality. Several studies have already identified single symptoms statistically predictive for EVD mortality, such as confusion [ 15 – 17 ], diarrhoea,[ 16 , 18 ] asthenia [ 15 , 18 ], hiccups [ 14 ], haemorrhagic signs [ 14 , 16 , 19 ], dizziness [ 18 ], extreme fatigue [ 15 ], and high viral load [ 14 , 17 , 18 , 20 ]. However, the various permutations in which symptoms occur in each individual, necessitates a multivariate approach to more accurately predict mortality.
The Ebola virus has been hypothesized to exercise its diverse range of virulence through the mammalian immune system. Here, it causes a pathologic overstimulation of innate immune receptors, triggering a flood of inflammation that causes collateral damage to multiple organ systems [ 21 , 22 ], and results in a wide range of symptomatic presentations [ 8 , 23 ]. It is then easy to imagine the additive detrimental effect of an inflammatory co-infection such as the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The annual incidence of malaria in Sierra Leone is 350 cases per 1000 population and it has been reported to be more prevalent in EVD triaged patients than EVD itself [ 24 ]. However, despite these statistics, little is known about EVD/malaria co-infection or its effect on patient prognosis.
In this retrospective cohort study, we analyse the clinical and epidemiological data from 158 EVD(+) patients admitted to the GOAL-Mathaska ETC in Port Loko, Sierra Leone. We investigate the role of malaria in EVD pathogenesis and evaluate the potential of the clinical characteristics in predicting EVD mortality at triage as well as in on each day of patient care. Further, we use these results to construct a statistically weighted disease scoring and staging system, which identifies the most prevalent factors that are predictive of mortality.
Methods
Study design
This retrospective cohort study uses anonymized patient data collected between December 14, 2014 and November 15, 2015 at the GOAL ETC in Port Loko, Sierra Leone. Data comprised patient demographics, geographic location, clinical signs and symptoms, and laboratory results (for malaria infection and semi-quantitative Ebola viremia), as well as the final patient outcome of death or survival. We evaluate the potential of clinical characteristics in predicting EVD mortality and use these results to construct a symptom-based disease staging system, which corresponds to the prognostic power of the most prevalent symptoms.
Patient referral
The ETC was run by the humanitarian organization GOAL Global in cooperation with the Sierra Leonean Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS). The ETC opened in December 2014 and accepted 600 patients from a catchment area spanning 200km. EVD surveillance in Sierra Leone was implemented through District Ebola Response Centres (DERCs). Individuals who were sick were encouraged to report their illness (or the suspected illness of others) via the national or district Ebola call-lines. Individuals that met the WHO case definition for EVD [ 25 ], as well as those with confirmed EVD infection, were referred to the ETC from surrounding communities, holding centres, health facilities, and quarantine houses. All EVD(+) patients were treated according to standard treatment protocols developed by WHO and Médecins Sans Frontières [ 13 , 26 ]. This included empiric antimalarial treatment (Artesunate and Amodiaquine), broad-spectrum antibiotics, and nutritional supplementation for all patients, as well as oral or intravenous fluid rehydration.
Data collection
Signs and symptoms were recorded daily, on admission and throughout the patients’ length of stay at the ETC. Once triaged, blood was drawn and tested for EVD in on-site laboratories managed by Public Heath England. EVD diagnosis was determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) as previously described [ 27 ]. Briefly, the cycle threshold (Ct) value was used as an inverse proxy for viral load and a cut-off of 40 was used to discriminate between positive and negative values. Patients qualified as EVD(-) and were discharged from the ETC after returning two negative Ebola-specific qRT-PCR tests. Histidine-rich protein-II (HRP-II) antigen rapid diagnostic kits were used for testing of malaria infections, which were performed on admission at the ETC.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms were reported by the patient during a comprehensive questionnaire by trained staff. Haemorrhaging, pyrexia, and disorientation were recorded by clinicians after examination. Haemorrhagic signs included visible blood loss such as hematochezia, hematemesis, haematuria, epistaxis, haemoptysis or persistent haemorrhage from an IV catheter site as well as subcutaneous haemorrhage such as purpura and petechiae. Pyrexia was defined as a body temperature over 38°C, measured using an infrared thermal sensor. Disorientation was measured by trained ETC clinicians as per the AVPU alertness scale (where pain and unconsciousness were considered “disorientated”). Additionally, any specific mention of “confusion” or “disorientation” in the medical notes was also considered a positive for this variable.
Cohorts and inclusion criteria
Of the 600 patients admitted to the ETC, 10 were declared dead on arrival and 24 were classified as late transfers from other ETCs or holding centres (treated elsewhere and thus convalescent on arrival) or had incomplete data. Thus, a total of 34 patients were excluded from this analysis. Of the 566 patients involved in the study, 100% had diagnostic test results for EVD, where 27.9% tested EVD(+) (n = 158). 543/566 patients had malaria test results, of which 34.6% were malaria(+) (n = 188). The cohort was evaluated for missing values in each variable. Referral time (the time in days from symptom onset to admission at the ETC) had 20 cases of missing data. Further analysis was undertaken to evaluate the aetiology of missingness, which included demographic variables (such as age and sex), clinical severity variables (such as EVD viral load) as well as the covariates used in the final scoring model. Here, we found that subjects with missing data did not differ systematically from those with observed referral time, which is in favour of the hypothesis that the data were missing completely at random. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis using the “Hotdeck” imputation technique, which showed that the model coefficients did not change when using complete data [ 28 ]. The patient catchment area and mortality rates can be visualised in S1 Fig .
Data entry
Ethical approval for this research was granted by the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee (SLESRC). To maximize data fidelity, patient files were entered into a secure Microsoft Excel database and crosschecked by 3 independent and trained analysts. Entry of clinical data was overseen by members of the clinical ETC staff. Graphs were constructed using Graphpad Prism, version 6. Univariate and multivariate analysis was conducted using STATA software, version 14 (StataCorp). Score validation was performed using “RMS” R-Package (R Development Core Team. ISBN 3-900051-07-0, URL: http://www.R-project.org ). Results were deemed statistically significant at a p-value of less than 0.05.
Primary data Analysis
Epidemiological data and symptoms were summarized by their frequencies and percentages. Univariate logistic regression was performed to assess the association between each predictor and the outcome of death (reported as Odds-Ratios (OR) and p-values). Potential interactions were tested (such as the effect of sex, age, referral time and Ebola contact). The functional relation between the outcome of death and continuous variables (age, days admitted, referral time and EVD viral load) were checked using a fractional polynomial model. The linearity assumption was confirmed for days admitted and referral time but not for age ( S2 Fig ) or Ct Value ( S3 Fig ). To simplify the prognostic score, age was coded into three categories: (1) <5 years + [25–45] years, (2) [5–25] years, and (3) >45 years. S2 Fig shows the rationale for the chosen categories on their polynomial curve. The 5–25 group is used as a reference, being the lowest risk group. Comparing the <5 years category to the reference, we obtained an OR of 5.35 (p = 0.006), while the 25–45 category returned an OR of 2.61 (p = 0.002). Comparisons between the 0–5 and 25–45 groups, however, showed that they were not significantly different (p = 0.2) and they could thus be grouped to simplify the user interface of the score. The area under the ROC curves for the scoring systems presented in this study were not statistically different when comparing these age categorisations with the polynomial function of age as a continuous variable. However, a continuous function would undoubtedly be more accurate on a larger sample size.
For PCR results, a Ct value lower than 20 cycles was categorized as “high viral load” and correlated to the natural threshold for the probability of fatal outcome ( S3 Fig , dotted line). As there was an insufficient number of patients in the survival group (death = 96, survival = 62) compared to the number of 31 potential predictors, only the predictors associated to the outcome at level of p<0.20 were considered into a Stepwise Backward selection procedure to fit a multivariable logistic regression model [ 29 ]. The “daily” score for calculating risk after triage would ideally be handled with a time-dependent model in order to limit immortal time bias. However, these were not a good fit for our data, as the proportionality-hazards assumption was violated by non-parallel lines between categorical variables on log-log plots. Thus, a logistic multivariate model was privileged. Model diagnostics were performed to check for influential observations that impact coefficient estimates and a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was performed to assess calibration. Discriminative performance of the final model was assessed by calculating the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve (AUC) and its 95% confidence interval.
Calculation of the prognostic scores and model validation
The β-coefficient = log(OR) of each covariate of the final model was converted into an integer-based point-scoring system. The score was then derived as the sum of the covariates’ weighted scores. Internal validation using the bootstrap method (repeated 1000 times) as described in Harrell et al [ 30 ] was used to provide a more accurate estimate of the performance of the original model (model based score: AUCoriginal). The algorithm calculates the optimism of the predictive discrimination in the original model. The difference (AUCoriginal−optimism) gives the bootstrap-corrected (i.e. internally validated) performance of the original model. As described in Steyerberg et al [ 31 ], bootstrapping has unavoidable limitations in small cohorts with a large number of predictors.

Results
1. Epidemiological characteristics of EVD outcome
Of the 566 patients included in this study, 27.9% tested positive for EVD (n = 158). The crude mortality rate among EVD(+) patients was 60.8% ( Fig 1A ). Mortality rates were slighter higher in males (68.4% vs. 53.7%), with a statistically insignificant 1.9 fold increase in odds of death (p = 0.06) ( Fig 1B ). EVD survivors were on average 10 years younger than those who died (24.9 years vs. 34.3 years, p = 0.014) ( Fig 1C ). However, mean age of death did not differ among EVD(-) patients who died before being transferred out of the ETC ( Fig 1C ) or among genders (p>0.05). In general, case fatality rates for EVD were higher at the youngest and oldest extremes of age. The patient group aged between 5 and 24 years had the lowest mortality rate of 42.5%, which was significantly lower than other age groups. The over-45’s and under-5’s were particularly vulnerable, being 11.6 and 5.4 fold more likely to die, respectively ( Fig 1D ). Age groups were selected in order to ensure the mathematic simplicity of the final score. The polynomial curve of this continuous variable is shown in S2 Fig . Categorisation did not significantly alter the accuracy of the final scores (p>0.05).

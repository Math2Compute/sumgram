Please treat as Gift Aid donations all qualifying gifts of money made today, in the past 4 years and in the future. I confirm I have paid or will pay an amount of UK Income Tax and/or Capital Gains Tax for each tax year that is at least equal to the amount of tax that all the charities or community amateur sports clubs that I donate to will reclaim on my gifts for that tax year. I understand that other taxes such as VAT and Council Tax do not qualify. I understand the charity will reclaim 25p of tax on every £1 that I have given

China’s FDA Approves Application for Registering Recombinant Ebola Virus Vaccine
(Yicai Global) Oct. 20 -- The China Food and Drug Administration approved an application for registering a recombinant (adenovirus vector) Ebola virus vaccine that that Military Medical Science Academy’s Biology Engineering Research Institute and CanSino Biologics Inc. developed as a new drug yesterday.
China independently created this vaccine and owns its full proprietary intellectual property rights.
The worst Ebola outbreak occurred in West Africa in 2014, killing at least 11,300 people. The World Health Organization listed it as one of the most serious diseases that endanger humans.
The newly-approved vaccine adopts cutting-edge replication-defective virus vector technology and serum-free high-density suspension cultivation technology. It can activate human cellular immunity and humoral immunity, ensuring safety and immunogenicity.
The vaccine marks a breakthrough from the technological bottleneck of lyophilized preparation of virus vector vaccines. Before the introduction of this vaccine, only the US and Russia had Ebola vaccines available. Compared with liquid Ebola vaccines, China’s lyophilized Ebola vaccine is more stable, which is advantageous especially during transportation and use in high-temperature areas, such as Africa.

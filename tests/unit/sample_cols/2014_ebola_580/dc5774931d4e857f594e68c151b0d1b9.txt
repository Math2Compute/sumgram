Postexposure prophylaxis
favipiravir with or without monoclonal antibodies targeting an Ebola virus                      glycoprotein reported to prevent Ebola virus infection in healthcare workers at                      intermediate or high risk ( level 3 [lacking direct] evidence )
based on case series
4 healthcare workers who had needlestick injuries while working in Ebola                         treatment unit (classified as intermediate- or high-risk exposure) received                         oral favipiravir for 10 days and followed for 42 days
treatment initiated 6-10 hours after potential exposure
loading doses 2,400 mg, 2,400 mg, and 1,200 mg every 8 hours on day 1,                               followed by maintenance dose 1,200 mg twice daily
2 patients also treated with 2 IV doses of monoclonal antibodies to Ebola                         virus glycoprotein
1 patient received ZMAb on day 2 after exposure (total dose 50 mg/kg)                               and then MIL77 on day 5 (total dose 50 mg/kg)
1 patient received MIL77 on days 2 and 5 after exposure (total 50                               mg/kg per dose)
no patient developed Ebola virus disease
no serious adverse effects reported
self-limited symptoms without Ebola virus disease reported in 6 persons who                   received rVSV-ZEBOV or TKM-100802 for postexposure prophylaxis after occupational                   exposure to Zaire ebolavirus in West Africa between September 2014 and April 2015                      ( Clin                      Infect Dis 2016 Aug 1;63(3):376 )

vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored Ebola vaccine
vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored Zaire Ebola vaccine appears to                            prevent transmission of Ebola virus disease ( level 2                               [mid-level] evidence )
based on cluster-randomized trial with low adherence
98 clusters containing 9,096 persons in Guinea were randomized to                               immediate vaccination with VSV-ZEBOV vs. delayed vaccination (21 days                               after randomization)
clusters were generated using a ring vaccination strategy, and                                     consisted of contacts and contacts-of-contacts of patients with                                     newly confirmed Ebola virus disease
vaccination was 1 dose of 2 × 107 plaque-forming                                     units intramuscularly
6,328 persons met eligibility criteria for vaccination (age ≥ 18                               years, not pregnant, breastfeeding, or severely ill), of whom 66% had                               scheduled vaccination
comparing immediate vaccination vs. delayed vaccination, Ebola virus                               disease with symptom onset ≥ 10 days after randomization occurred in
0 persons (0%) vs. 16 persons (0.5%) in per-protocol analysis (p                                     = 0.0045)

19 additional clusters with 2,745 contacts and contacts of contacts                               identified
1,677 were immediately vaccinated (including 194 children)
no cases of Ebola virus disease with symptom onset ≥ 10 days                                     after study entry occurred among vaccinated persons
in analysis of all 117 clusters
0 persons with immediate vaccination developed Ebola virus                                     disease vs. 23 persons in delayed vaccination clusters or in                                     immediate clusters who were never vaccinated (p = 0.0033)
estimated vaccine efficacy 100% (95% CI 79.3%-100%)
3,149 of 5,837 persons who received vaccine reported ≥ 1 adverse event                               within 14 days of vaccination
87.5% classified as mild, with headache, fatigue, and muscle                                     pain most common
80 serious adverse events occurred
2 determined to be related to vaccination (1 febrile                                           reaction, 1 anaphylaxis) and 1 possibly related                                           (influenza-like illness)

DynaMed commentary
-- ring vaccination refers to a                               strategy in which direct contacts and/or contacts of contacts of                               patients with diagnosed disease are identified and vaccinated
vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored Zaire Ebola vaccine may induce sustained immune response for up to 6 months but has high rate of transient, mild-to-moderate adverse events ( level 2 [mid-level] evidence )
based on analysis of phase 1 study data collected in 3 cohort studies and 1 quasi-randomized randomized trial

at 6-month follow-up, 100% of vaccinated persons had geometric mean titer of neutralizing antibodies > 8
92% reported ≥ 1 adverse event within 2 weeks, mostly mild-to-moderate and transient with median onset and median duration of 1 day, including
fever in 30%
arthritis observed in the second week of vaccination
affecting up to 4 joints in 22% of 51 persons in Geneva, with pain persisting for median duration of 8 days
self-limiting cases in 2 (3%) of 60 persons in all other locations
no serious vaccine-associated adverse events reported
low dose of vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored Zaire Ebola vaccine                            associated with reduced immune response compared to high dose of vaccine                               ( level 3                               [lacking direct] evidence ) and may not reduce risk adverse                            events ( level 2                               [mid-level] evidence )
based on interim analysis of quasi-randomized trial

vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored Ebola vaccine reported to induce                            immune response in patient with high-risk exposure to Ebola virus                               ( level 3                               [lacking direct] evidence )
based on case report
44-year-old physician working in Ebola treatment unit in Sierra Leone                               had vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored Ebola vaccine 43 hours after                               needlestick
patient developed fever and moderate-to-severe symptoms 12 hours after                               vaccination which diminished over 3-4 days
antibodies and T cells active against vaccine components detected 1                               day after vaccination, but no evidence of viral infection detected
Ebola virus and Marburg virus                   glycoprotein DNA vaccines induce immune response when given alone or together                      ( level 3 [lacking direct]                      evidence )
based on randomized trial without clinical outcomes
108 healthy volunteers received intramuscular injections at weeks 0, 4, and 8
during part 1, 72 patients were randomized to Ebola virus vaccine only (encoding Zaire and Sudan glycoproteins) vs. Marburg virus vaccine only (encoding Marburg virus glycoprotein) vs. placebo
during part 2, 36 patients were randomized to Ebola virus vaccine plus Marburg virus vaccine vs. placebo
antibody and T-cell response measured 4 weeks after third vaccination
in patients given Ebola virus vaccine alone
57% had antibody response to Zaire glycoprotein and 63% had T-cell response
50% had antibody response to Sudan glycoprotein and 43% had T-cell response
in patients given Marburg virus vaccine alone, 31% had antibody response and 52% had T-cell response
no significant difference in antibody or T-cell response if vaccines given alone or together
no significant differences in local or systemic adverse effects among groups
similar results reported in earlier phase 1 trial with 20 patients ( J Infect Dis 2015 Feb 15;211(4):549 )
adenovirus-vectored Ebola vaccine
adenovirus-vectored Ebola vaccine appears safe and immunogenic, although immunogenicity appears to decline over time ( level 3 [lacking direct] evidence )
based on randomized trial without clinical outcomes
500 healthy adults aged 18-50 years without history of Ebola virus infection or previous Ebola vaccination with any vaccine formulation randomized to
high-dose adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine (1.6 × 1011 viral particles)
low-dose adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine (8 × 1010 viral particles)
placebo
no significant differences in rates of overall solicited adverse reactions within 7 days (43%-53%), although placebo associated with lower rate of solicited injection-site adverse reactions within 7 days vs. either vaccine formulation (14% vs. 25%-26%, p = 0.0169)
3 serious adverse events occurred in high-dose vaccine group (malaria, gastroenteritis, and fatal asthma episodes), but none determined to be related to vaccine
